One of the main purposes of a greenhouse is to grow\n          tomatoes, flowers and other plants that might struggle to grow\n          outside. A greenhouse stays warm inside, even during winter. Sunlight\n          shines in and warms the plants and air inside. But the heat is trapped\n          by the glass and cannot escape. So during the daylight hours, it gets\n          warmer and warmer inside a greenhouse, and stays quite warm at night\n          too.\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <strong>B.</strong>\n        <span>\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"i\">i</option>\n            <option value=\"ii\">ii</option>\n            <option value=\"iii\">iii</option>\n            <option value=\"v\">v</option>\n          </select>\n          The Earth experiences a similar thing to a greenhouse. Gases in the\n          atmosphere such as carbon dioxide do what the roof of a greenhouse\n          does. During the day, the Sun shines through the atmosphere. Earth’s\n          surface warms up in the sunlight. At night, Earth’s surface cools,\n          releasing the heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped\n          by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is what keeps our\n          Earth a warm and comfortable 59 degrees Fahrenheit, on average.\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <strong>C.</strong>\n        <span>\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"i\">i</option>\n            <option value=\"ii\">ii</option>\n            <option value=\"iii\">iii</option>\n            <option value=\"v\">v</option>\n          </select>\n          However, gas molecules, called greenhouse gases, that absorb thermal\n          infrared radiation, and are in significant enough quantity, can force\n          and alter the climate system.

In Josef Werne’s opinion, an associate professor\n          at the department of geology & planetary science at the University of\n          Pittsburgh told Live Science, we have three options. Firstly to do\n          nothing and live with the consequences. Secondly, to adapt to the\n          changing climate (which includes things like rising sea level and\n          related flooding). Thirdly, mitigate the impact of climate change by\n          aggressively enacting policies that actually reduce the concentration\n          of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <button className=\"q-a\">\n        <b>Answers</b>\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  `,\n  header3: `\n  <div className=\"header2Class\">\n  <h3>Locating Information Practice Exercise</h3>\n  <p></p>Answer questions 1-6 which are based on the reading passage below.\n  <h3>Incredible Journeys Reading Passage</h3>\n  <div>\n    <strong>A.</strong>\n    <span>\n      The nervous system of the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis, with around\n      100,000 neurons, is about 1 millionth the size of a human brain. Yet,\n      in the featureless deserts of Tunisia, this ant can venture over 100\n      meters from its nest to find food without becoming lost. Imagine\n      randomly wandering 20 kilometres in the open desert, your tracks\n      obliterated by the wind, then turning around and making a beeline to\n      your starting point - and no GPS allowed! That's the equivalent of\n      what the desert ant accomplishes with its scant neural resources. How\n      does it do it?\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>B</strong>\n    <span>\n      Jason, a graduate student studying the development of human and animal\n      cognition, discusses a remarkable series of experiments on the desert\n      ant on his blog, The Thoughtful Animal. In work spanning more than 30\n      years, researchers from Rüdiger Wehner's laboratory at the University\n      of Zurich Institute of Zoology carefully tracked the movements of ants\n      in the desert as the insects foraged for food. One of the researchers'\n      key questions was how the ants calculated the direction to their nest.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>C</strong>\n    <span>\n      To check for the possibility that the ants used landmarks as visual\n      cues, despite the relatively featureless desert landscape, the\n      researchers engaged in a bit of trickery. They placed a food source at\n      a distance from a nest, then tracked the nest's ants until the ants\n      found the food. Once the food was found, the ants were relocated from\n      that point so that the way back to their nest was a different\n      direction than it would have been otherwise. The relocated ants walked\n      away from the nest, in the same direction they should have walked if\n      they had never been moved. This suggested that the ants are not\n      following features, but orienting themselves relative to an internal\n      navigation system or (as turned out to be the case) the position of\n      the Sun in the sky.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>D</strong>\n    <span>\n      No matter how convoluted a route the ants take to find the food, they\n      always return in a straight-line path, heading directly home. The\n      researchers discovered the ants navigation system isn't perfect, small\n      errors arise depending on how circuitous their initial route was. But\n      the ants account for these errors as well, by walking in a corrective\n      zigzag pattern as they approach the nest. So how do the ants know how\n      far to travel? It could still be that they are visually tracking the\n      distance they walk. The researchers tested this by painting over the\n      ants' eyes for their return trip, but the ants still walked the\n      correct distance, indicating that the ants are not using sight to\n      measure their journeys.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>E</strong>\n    <span>\n      Another possibility is that the ants simply count their steps. In a\n      remarkable experiment published in Science in 2006, scientists\n      painstakingly attached 'stilts' made of pig hairs to some of the ants'\n      legs, while other ants had their legs clipped, once they had reached\n      their food target. If the ants counted their steps on the journey out,\n      then the newly short-legged ants should stop short of the nest, while\n      stilted ants should walk past it. Indeed, this is what occurred! Ants\n      count their steps to track their location. (If only you had remembered\n      to do this before you started on your 20-kilometre desert trek!)\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>F</strong>\n    <span>\n      But other creatures have different navigation puzzles to solve. In a\n      separate post, Jason explains a study showing how maternal gerbils\n      find their nests. When a baby is removed from the nest, the gerbil\n      mother naturally tries to find and retrieve it. Researchers placed one\n      of the babies in a cup at the centre of a platform, shrouded in\n      darkness. When the mother found the baby, the platform was rotated.\n      Did she head for the new position of her nest, with its scents and\n      sounds of crying babies? No, she went straight to the spot where the\n      nest had been, ignoring all these other cues. For gerbils, relying on\n      the internal representation of their environment normally suffices, so\n      the other information goes unheeded.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>G</strong>\n    <span>\n      Migratory birds, on the other hand, must navigate over much larger\n      distances, some of them returning to the identical geographic spot\n      year after year. How do they manage this trick? One component,\n      University of Auckland researcher and teacher Fabiana Kubke reports,\n      is the ability to detect the Earth's magnetic field. Though we've\n      known about this avian sixth sense for some time, the location of a\n      bird's magnetic detector is still somewhat of a mystery. Last\n      November, however, a team led by Manuela Zapka published a letter in\n      Nature that narrowed the possibilities. Migratory European Robins have\n      magnetic material in their beaks, but also molecules called\n      cryptochromes in the back of their eyes that might be used as a sort\n      of compass. The team systematically cut the connections between these\n      two areas and the Robins' brains, finding that the ability to orient\n      to compass points was only disturbed when the connection to\n      cryptochromes was disrupted.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>H</strong>\n    <span>\n      Much remains to be learned about how birds can successfully migrate\n      over long distances. Unlike ants and gerbils, they can easily correct\n      for large displacements in location and return to the correct spot.\n    </span>\n    <div>\n      <h3>Questions 1- 6</h3>\n      <p>\n        This reading passage has eight paragraphs, <b>A–H.</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>Which paragraph contains the following information?</p>\n      <p>\n        Write the correct letter, <b>A - H</b>, as your answer to each\n        question.\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            An explanation of how adjustments are made when navigating\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            Recent news about how navigation systems work\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            A comparison of tracking abilities\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            A study showing that scent and sound are not important\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            Explaining the importance of counting\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            A description of how ants navigate\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n`,\n  header4: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h1>True False Not Given Practice Exercise</h1>\n      <p>\n        Answer questions <b>1-7</b> which are based on the reading passage\n        below.\n      </p>\n      <h2>A Secret Well Kept Reading Passage</h2>\n      <p>\n        Political leaders in the days before the internet and 24-hour cable news\n        were not subjected to the intense media scrutiny that their modern\n        counterparts face. It was possible to rise to power and stay in office\n        despite having skeletons in the closet that would now see one disgraced\n        in a scandal. One of the best examples of keeping damaging secrets from\n        the public was Canadian Prime Minister, Lyon Mackenzie King, (almost\n        always referred to as Mackenzie King).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Mackenzie King was born in 1874 with the proverbial silver spoon. He\n        accumulated five university degrees, including a PhD from Harvard in\n        economics, a subject he went on to teach at that institute. In addition\n        to being a professor and an economist, King was a lawyer and a\n        journalist. He was also a civil servant and was appointed as Canada's\n        first Minister of Labour. He was elected to Parliament as a Liberal and\n        would go on to become Canada’s, and the Commonwealth's longest-serving\n        prime minister, serving for nearly 22 years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Mackenzie King cut his political teeth as a labour negotiator. He was\n        successful in part because he mastered the art of conciliation.\n        Conciliation, along with half measures, would become his trademark. 'Do\n        nothing by halves that can be done by quarters,” one detractor wrote of\n        him. And so, King sought the middle ground in order to keep the\n        country’s many factions together. He would go out of his way to avoid\n        debate and was fond of saying 'Parliament will decide,' when pressed for\n        an answer. He was pudgy, plodding, wooden and cold, and his speeches\n        were slumber-inducing. Unloved, but practical and astute, he has been\n        called Canada's greatest prime minister. He created old age pensions,\n        unemployment insurance, and family allowance, and he left the country in\n        much better shape than when he inherited it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Mackenzie King died in 1950, thus passing into the mildly-interesting\n        annals of Canadian history. Then, during the seventies, his diaries (all\n        30,000 pages of them) were published, and millions of Canadian jaws\n        dropped. It turns out that King, that monotonous embodiment of\n        Presbyterian morals, was a dedicated occultist who communicated with the\n        dead, including his mother (who he revered), former President Roosevelt,\n        Leonardo da Vinci, and his dogs. And he did this almost every evening\n        for the last 25 years of his life.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        King used a Ouija board and owned a crystal ball. He read tea leaves.

Foreing\n        places, stressful conditions, and absence from home can foster an\n        out-of-the-classroom education that crosses the boundary of the odd and\n        unusual. Today, tales of strange sea creatures and haunted islands seem\n        like a bad Sci-Fi marathon. But these were realities for one U.S. Army\n        soldier stationed overseas at the thrun of the 20th century.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The art of journal keeping, letter writing and daily diary entries are\n        becoming extinct as methods of memory management are changing in today's\n        technology driven world. What once was detailed on paper with memory\n        fresh at hand is now posted on YouTube Today, blogs replace diary\n        entries. Hand-written letters to loved ones are far slower than a quick\n        Facebook 'poke' or a cell phone text message.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Historians enjoy a deep appreciation for the written word. They savour\n        the ability to see the world through the eyes of someone who never had\n        satellite TV, the Internet or cell phone. Where explanation was not\n        readily at hand in the strange lands of the Philippine Islands, the\n        environment was ripe for adventure and the unknown. Placing one's self\n        in such situations fosters an education that cannot be duplicated in any\n        classroom, book or blockbuster movie. A survivor of deadly and savage\n        situations, Colonel Horace P. Hoobs recorded these well-documented\n        experiences that lend a degree of depth to the retelling and\n        re-imagining of Army history.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The odd education of Colonel Horace P. Hobbs is revealed in his\n        voluminous personal papers held at the U.S. Army Military History\n        Institute. A letter of August 16, 1918, soothes his wife while he is\n        stationed in France during World War I. 'You see it is the women who\n        suffer most during a war. Now I know you and mother are worrying about\n        me and I am living in the most luxurious comfort and perfect safety just\n        now.' He goes to great lengths to explain his lush surroundings and the\n        comfort he is experiencing, from bathing in a nearby brook to the size\n        of his room and the servants who provide for him, as he attempts to\n        console a worry-sick wife. It would seem, however, that Mrs Hobbs had\n        been through worse as a military spouse.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Her husband was stationed in the Philippines during the insurrection\n        from 1899 to 1901. Colonel Hobbs wrote a book from his collected\n        journals and memoirs entitled, 'Kris and Krag: Adventures among the\n        Moros of the Southern Philippine Islands'. Among his many tales, the\n        Colonel tells about a strange native custom on one of the small islands\n        of taking their boats across a narrow strait to another island and\n        returning before dark. They explained to him that the island was the\n        home of the 'wok-wok', a powerful ghost who must be appeased with gifts\n        of rice so they will not harm the people. Upon further inspection, the\n        Army discovered the 'wok-wok’ to be large apes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Another bizarre chapter in the Colonel's education came when he was\n        asked by some villagers to kill a sea creature which wreaked havoc among\n        the people whenever they Slaughtered an animal for food. The blood would\n        run into the water, and out would come the creature. The Colonel waited\n        for the apparition to appear after a slaughter, and he was not\n        disappointed. Upon further inspection he described the animal as being\n        some kind of mix between an alligator and a crocodile, but one he had\n        never seen before.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Experience in foreign places, blended with curiosity and a desire to\n        learn, enabled Colon to obtain a far greater grasp of the world. These\n        traits provided him with an education that the average person today\n        cannot obtain from watching television or searching the web.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Questions 1-5</h3>\n      <p>Choose the correct letter, a, b, c or d.</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li className=\"optionClass\">\n          What offers a non-traditional form of education?\n          <ul>\n            <li> a.

The objects in these museums were\n        displayed in Cabinets of Curiosities, also called Cabinets of Wonder or\n        Wonder Rooms. The word “cabinet” was then used to describe a room and\n        not a piece of furniture. The oldest recorded example of such was the\n        Ennigaldi Nanna’s museum that was located in Mesopotamia. It was founded\n        in 530 BC.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Before the 18th century, only elite or respectable members of society,\n        by the standards of that era, could visit museums with permission from\n        the owner and the staff. The first museums to be opened for the general\n        public were the British Museum in London in 1759 and the Uffizi Gallery\n        in Florence in 1765. However, even though they were no longer exclusive\n        places, only people from the middle and upper className were privileged\n        with a written permission request. Also, the visitations were often\n        limited to a few hours. The first public museum in its true sense was\n        the Louvre in Paris which was opened in 1793 to people of any status and\n        age, emerging as an agent of nationalistic fervor.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, societies began to\n        regard museums as centers of the production of new knowledge. Historical\n        museums shifted focus to display scientific discoveries and artistic\n        developments with collections that could be useful for research also.\n        Over the twentieth century, as cities increased in size, wealth, and\n        population, more museums developed. These were shaped by the public\n        response to education and entertainment. Greater funding was directed\n        towards the development of modern museums. Study programs dedicated to\n        the field of art and culture were created to promote the growth of\n        museums, and activities such as the collection and preservation of\n        artifacts such as paintings or sculptures had consequently become more\n        organized. Even wealthy industrialists such as Henry Ford and Henry\n        Mercer contributed their collections leading to the development of more\n        privately run museums.\n      </p>\n      <b>Part B</b>\n      <p>\n        A breeze of change was once again felt in the early 21st century.\n        Museums were no longer anchored to the national ideal and today’s new\n        museums attract intellectuals as well as tourists and students.\n        Attitudes toward museums have become more favorable as people no longer\n        view them as boring, cold places that drag you to the past.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One of the main factors that have contributed to this is technology.\n        Modern museums have embraced technology with considerable use of\n        multimedia, digital displays, touch screens as well as other interactive\n        technologies. Some museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in\n        New York, use technology that allows visitors to see the objects, hear\n        or read about the collection on their smartphones by scanning the\n        artwork. Other national museums have also followed suit by embracing\n        mobile interactivity. The Smithsonian Institution, which is the world’s\n        largest museum and research complex containing 19 museums and galleries,\n        provides cell phone tours, interactive games like Pheon, which is a\n        multimedia scavenger hunt game, multilingual slideshows, and even\n        augmented reality apps such as one from the postal museum showing Owney,\n        the mascot of the Railway Mail Service.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Additionally, there are some museums such as the National Museum of\n        African Art that have the Artists in Dialogue 2 app, which allows for\n        visual calls and responses that cut across physical and political\n        borders. The app facilitates a guided tour of the museum with the\n        curator virtually, and also allows the user to experiment with the\n        artistic technique in a virtual art-development game. The user can even\n        communicate with active groups of the museum on social media.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So far, technology has provided modern-day museums with the opportunity\n        to share images and works of art with more people than ever before.\n        However, the conclusion is that technology is enhancing and not\n        replacing the brick and mortar museums since technology cannot replace a\n        live experience for the viewer such as live interaction with the\n        experts, emotional reactions, and the physicality of artworks.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1 - 5</h4>\n      <p>Complete the summary below.</p>\n      <p>\n        Write <i>ONE WORD ONLY</i> from <b>Part A</b> of the passage for each\n        answer.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The earliest museums displayed personal 1\n        <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n        belonging to rich people, and until the eighteenth century, only the\n        elite className could visit these places.

The first, the\n        reaction stage, is when a glass beaker is placed on top of a tripod, and\n        20cm of dilute sulphuric acid poured into it. The acid is then heated.\n        When it is almost boiling, a small quantity of copper oxide powder is\n        added to the beaker. The mixture is then stirred with a glass spatula\n        until the copper oxide has dissolved. This process is then repeated\n        until 1g of powder has been added to the sulphuric acid. The heat is\n        then removed from the beaker and the solution allowed to cool. The\n        second stage is the filtration stage and, as the name suggests, is where\n        a filter and conical flask are used to remove any copper oxide that has\n        not reacted. A clear copper sulphate solution will be left in the glass\n        dish. The third stage is where heat is applied to the copper sulphate\n        solution in order to concentrate the solution: the concentration stage.\n        The final crystallization stage happens when the solution begins to\n        cool, and pure copper sulphate crystals start to form.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1 – 6</h4>\n      <p>\n        The diagram below shows how copper sulphate can be made using simple\n        laboratory equipment.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Choose <b>NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS</b> from the reading passage for each\n        answer.\n      </p>\n      <p>Label the diagram.</p>\n      <h1>Paragraph</h1>\n      <textarea id=\"editor\" className=\"optionClass\"></textarea>\n    </div>`,\n  header8: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h2>Matching Sentence Endings Practice Exercise</h2>\n      <p>Answer questions 1-5 which are based on the reading passage below.</p>\n      <h3>\n        <b>The Penny Black Reading Passage</b>\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n        In 1840, the United Kingdom introduced the penny black, the first\n        adhesive postage stamp issued anywhere in the world.For many years the\n        postal service in the U.K. had been a very expensive service for\n        ordinary people to use. The costs were prohibitive, a single letter\n        sometimes costing a working person’s full day’s wage. The postal system\n        also had many strange anomalies, such as certain categories of mail\n        going free (and therefore being paid for by the charges on others),\n        newspapers going for nothing, most mail being paid for by the addressee\n        rather than by the sender, and so on.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There were moves for postal reform for many years, until eventually\n        these moves started gathering some force through the attention of many,\n        amongst whom Rowland Hill is the best known, and Robert Wallace, MP for\n        Greenock, was instrumental.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The story is long and involved, but eventually, The Penny Postage Bill\n        was passed by Parliament on 17 August 1839. Some basic elements of the\n        plan were the lowering of postage rates for basic letters to one penny,\n        the removal of certain idiosyncrasies, that prepayment would become\n        normal, and the availability of printed envelopes, letter sheets, and\n        labels to show prepayment. The “labels” were the penny black and\n        twopence blue.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A bookseller and printer from Dundee, James Chalmers, holds a strong\n        claim to be the actual inventor of the adhesive postage stamp. He is\n        said to have been interested in postal reform from about 1822, and to\n        have printed samples of his idea for printed gummed labels in August\n        1834. It seems that, although Hill also presented the idea of adhesive\n        stamps, he was probably keener on the use of standard prepaid letter\n        folders, such as were issued in 1840 using a design by William Mulready.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The new stamps went on sale on 1st May 1840 and were valid for postage\n        from 6th May 1840 (although some were used during the 1st-5th May\n        period). The Mulreadies were issued at the same time. Public reaction to\n        these new items was quite the opposite to Rowland Hill’s expectations.\n        The labels were well-received and admired; the Mulready design was\n        lambasted and ridiculed. Initial supplies of the stamps were rushed\n        through the printing and distribution process, but supplies soon caught\n        up with requirements.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The stamps were printed in sheets of 240, engraved on steel plates, on\n        gummed paper with a single small crown watermark on each stamp. Eleven\n        different printing plates were used, and it is possible in almost every\n        case to work out which plate any individual stamp was printed from by a\n        few characteristics. Things like the positioning of the corner letters\n        within their squares, the presence of the “O flaw”, which rays of the\n        stars in the upper corners are broken at what points, and so on, can\n        point to a correct plate identification, but more specialised literature\n        is required in order to do this. Some plates are scarcer than others,\n        plate 11 being the scarcest.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Every penny black stamp has letters in the lower two corners. These\n        simply identify what sheet position the stamp occupied. When the\n        printing plates were produced the lower squares were blank, and the\n        letters were punched in by hand. The left square letter shows which\n        horizontal row the stamp was in – the first row being A, the second B,\n        and so on down to the twentieth row with T. The right square letter\n        indicates the vertical column, again with A for the first column, B, C,\n        and so on across to L for the last (twelfth) column. It should be noted\n        therefore that each letter combination is just as common or as scarce as\n        any other.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There were 68,158,080 penny blacks issued (yes, 68 million!), and even\n        with only a 2% survival rate, there are likely to be about 1.3 million\n        still in existence. The survival rate may well be considerably higher\n        than 2%, as it should be remembered that in 1840 the use of envelopes\n        was unusual, most letters being written, folded, and sealed with sealing\n        wax; this meant that whenever a letter was filed in a lawyer’s office,\n        bank, etc., the whole thing would be kept – letter and outer cover\n        including the adhesive stamp.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        From the collector's perspective, the physical condition of the stamp –\n        any fault such as a thin, tear, crease, or stain will lower the value,\n        and the number, size, and regularity of the margins make a big\n        difference to value. The stamps were not perforated and had to be\n        separated using scissors or a knife. As there was only about 1mm between\n        one stamp and another, it was very easy to stray just a little and cut\n        into the printed design of the stamp. A stamp with two full margins and\n        perhaps a couple of other part margins is about average. Collectors will\n        pay higher prices for examples with four good, wide, and even margins.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1-5</h4>\n      <p>Complete each sentence with the correct ending, A–G, below.</p>\n      <p>\n        <i>Write the correct letter, A-G, as your answer to each question. </i>\n      </p>\n      <ul style={{ listStyleType: \"none\" }}>\n        <li>\n          1 After reforms, most mails was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          2 Each steel printing plate was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          3 Every penny black was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          4 Putting a letter in an envelope was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          5 Keeping the borders of each stamp was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>A Unusual in 1840.</li>\n        <li>B Able to print sheets of 240 stamps.</li>\n        <li>C Paid for by the sender.</li>\n        <li>D Very difficult to achieve.</li>\n        <li>E Very expensive to send.</li>\n        <li>F Designed with two letters in the bottom corners.</li>\n        <li>G Quickly accepted.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>`,\n  header9: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h2>Matching features Practice Exercise</h2>\n      <p>\n        <i>\n          Answer questions 1-7 which are based on the reading passage below.\n        </i>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Objects From Different Civilizations Reading Passage</h3>\n      <p>\n        Objects from lost civilisations can tell us about the social\n        relationships and the way of life of the people belonging to those\n        societies. The Indus valley civilisation and the Chinese civilisation\n        have been influential with their innovations and contributions to\n        advanced technology. The Indus Valley civilization is also called the\n        Harappan civilization. Developing along the mighty Indus River, it was\n        at its peak around 2500 and 3500 BC. This Bronze Age civilisation is\n        believed to be among the oldest world civilisations together with the\n        Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations. The famous figurine of the\n        dancing girl from the Harappa region shows the advances made in art and\n        metallurgy at the time. The statue describes details such as the\n        hairstyle and ornaments prevalent then such as the more than 20 bangles\n        in her left arm and four on her right arm, and the necklace. Although\n        the bronze statuette is in standing position, it was named the dancing\n        girl by assuming that it was her profession.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The seals are other famous objects from the Bronze Age. Seals are\n        beautifully carved out of stone and then fired for durability. Over\n        3,500 seals discovered are mostly square with different symbols at the\n        top, an animal in the centre and a few more symbols at the bottom are,\n        which are presumed to be the inscription of the Indus valley language.\n        The inscription indicates that people of this age wrote the first line\n        from right to left, the second line from left to right and so on. Some\n        common animal inscriptions on these seals include elephants, unicorns,\n        rhinoceros, and bulls. On the reverse face, most seals have projections\n        with a hole to possibly carry it comfortably. The imprint on some of the\n        seals suggests that they were used as clay tags for sacks of traded\n        goods such as grain, which means that the Harappan people were involved\n        in long-distance trading networks. Hunting tools show that the Indus\n        people were fond of game. Many of the toys are carts and animals made\n        from baked clay, and most were for children, which has led to the\n        conclusion that the people had an active social life.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Standardised measurement is another valuable contribution of the Indus\n        valley people. The oldest ruler with markings was a copper alloy rod\n        found by a German archaeologist and he claims that it was used as a\n        standard measurement unit. He mentions that the measurements on the\n        ruler are divided into units that correspond to 1.32 inches which are\n        further divided into perfectly calculated decimal subdivisions.\n        Measurements of the bricks found in excavations of the Mohenjo Daro and\n        Harappan civilisations match with those on the ruler mentioned by the\n        German archaeologist.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        China was the first nation to invent paper. In the older civilisations,\n        words were written on natural materials such as grass stalks, earthen\n        plates, wood and bamboo strips, tree leaves, and sheepskins. The first\n        paper from the Chinese people was known as bo and was made of silk.\n        However, it was expensive. In the 2nd century, a new kind of paper was\n        produced from rags, bark, wheat stalks, and other materials, which was\n        not only cheaper but was also durable and could be used for brush\n        writing. Papermaking had spread to other parts of the world in the\n        beginning of the third century. Ancient China also gets credit for the\n        invention of gunpowder. In a collection of most important military\n        techniques as described in Wujing Zongyao that was edited in 1044 by\n        Zeng Gong Liang, three formulas of making gunpowder were discovered and\n        have been described as the earliest formulas of such kinds. Another\n        significant gift from China was the compass. It was developed after some\n        miners got hold of a piece of a natural magnetite that attracted iron\n        and pointed north. The compass that we use today is a result of a series\n        of improvements to the earliest design. Before it was invented,\n        navigators depended on the position of the moon, sun, and the polestar\n        for their bearings.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1-7</h4>\n      <p>\n        <i>\n

which are based on the reading passage\n        below.\n      </p>\n      <h3>The Halifax Explosion Reading Passage</h3>\n      <p>\n        Before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, the\n        largest-ever non-natural explosion had taken place in 1917 in the\n        eastern Canadian port city of Halifax. With the outbreak of World War I,\n        Halifax was effectively transformed into a boomtown. Convoys gathered\n        weekly in Bedford Basin (the north-western end of Halifax Harbour) in\n        order to traverse the Atlantic, and Halifax Harbour became heavy with\n        vessels of one variety or another. This spike in boat traffic was not\n        dealt with efficiently, and collisions became almost normal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On December 1st, 1917, the French vessel Mont Blanc left New York in\n        order to join a convoy in Halifax after being loaded with 226,797\n        kilograms of TNT (an explosive), 223,188 kilograms of benzol (a type of\n        gasoline), 1,602,519 kilograms of wet picric acid (an explosive), and\n        544,311 kilograms of dry picric acid (another explosive). On December\n        6th, the Mont Blanc was ushered into Halifax’s harbour after the U-boat\n        nets had been raised.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At the same time, the cargoless Norwegian ship, Imo, left Bedford Basin\n        en route to New York in order to pick up relief items for transport to\n        war-torn Belgium. Imo was behind schedule and attempting to remedy that.\n        She passed a boat on the wrong side before sending a tugboat retreating\n        to port. By the time she reached the Narrows, she was in the wrong\n        channel and going too fast. The Mont Blanc sounded her whistle, but the\n        Imo sounded back twice, refusing to alter course. At the last moment,\n        the Mont Blanc veered, and the Imo reversed, but it was too late. From\n        the gash formed in the French boat’s hull seeped a noxious spiral of\n        oily, orange-dappled smoke. Mont Blanc’s crew rowed to shore on the\n        Dartmouth side, but no one could decipher their warnings. Their fiery\n        vessel then casually drifted toward the Halifax side where it came to\n        rest against one of the piers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This spectacle drew thousands of onlookers. People crowded docks and\n        windows filled with curious faces. As many as 1,600 died instantly when\n        the boat exploded. Around 9,000 were injured, 6,000 seriously so.\n        Approximately 12,000 buildings were severely damaged; virtually every\n        building in town was damaged to some extent; 1,630 were rendered\n        nonexistent. Around 6,000 people were made homeless, and 25,000 people\n        (half the population) were left without suitable housing.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The Halifax Explosion, as it became known, was the largest manmade\n        detonation to date, approximately one-fifth the ferocity of the bomb\n        later dropped on Hiroshima. It sent up a column of smoke reckoned to be\n        7,000 metres in height. It was felt more than 480 kilometres away. It\n        flung a ship gun barrel some 5.5 kilometres, and part of an anchor,\n        which weighed 517 kilograms, around 3 kilometres. The blast absolutely\n        flattened a district known as Richmond. It also caused a tsunami that\n        saw a wave 18 metres above the high-water mark depositing the Imo onto\n        the shore of the Dartmouth side. The pressure wave of air that was\n        produced snapped trees, bent iron rails, and grounded ships. That\n        evening, a blizzard commenced, and it would continue until the next day,\n        leaving 40 centimetres of snow in its wake.

It is not truly native to Australia but is thought\n        to have arrived between 3,500 and 4,000 years ago. Whatever its origins,\n        the dingo was a highly valued companion to the aborigines. They were\n        hunting companions, guard dogs, and they kept them warm at night.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Some believe they were brought here on rafts or boats by the ancestral\n        aborigines. It has also been suggested that they came with Indonesian or\n        South-East Asian fishermen who visited the northern coast of Australia.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo can be found in all areas of Australia - from harsh deserts to\n        lush rainforest The highly adaptable dingo is found in every habitat and\n        every state of Australia,except Tasmania. In deserts, access to drinking\n        water determines where the animal can live. Purebred dingo numbers in\n        the wild are declining as man encroaches deeper and deeper into\n        wilderness areas, often accompanied by his domestic dog.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo is different from the modern dog in several ways: it does not\n        bark, it has a different gait, and its ears are always erect. Dingoes\n        are naturally lean, and they are usually cream to reddish-yellow with\n        white points, some are black with tan points. An adult dingo stands more\n        than 60cm high and weighs about 15kg. It is slightly smaller than a\n        German Shepherd.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In its natural state, the dingo lives either alone or in a small group,\n        unlike many other wild dog species which may form packs. Dingoes have a\n        clearly defined territory which they rarely leave and which they protect\n        from other dingoes, but which may be shared with dingoes when they form\n        a group to hunt larger prey. The size of the home territory varies\n        according to the food supply. Dingoes hunt mainly at night. Groups are\n        controlled by dominant male. Members of a group maintain contact by\n        marking rocks and trees within the territory, and by howling,\n        particularly in the breeding season.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo's diet consists of native mammals, including kangaroos,\n        although domestic animals and some farm stock are also on the menu. This\n        makes the animal unpopular with farmers. The dingo is thought to have\n        contributed to the mainland extinction of the thylacine through\n        increased competition for food.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo is an intelligent animal. It is no more dangerous to man than\n        any other feral dog. The natural prey of the dingo is small mammals and\n        ground-dwelling birds, but with the introduction of white settlement,\n        they became such a menace to sheep, calves and poultry that measures had\n        to be taken in an attempt to control them, such as dog-proof fences.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Dingoes start breeding when they reach the age of one or two but only\n        the dominant members within an established group breed. They breed only\n        once a year. Mating usually occurs in autumn/early winter, and after a\n        gestation of nine weeks (same as domestic dogs), a litter averaging 4-5\n        pups is born, which are reared in a hollow log, a rock-shelter, or an\n        old rabbit warren. Both parents take part in raising the pups. The pups\n        are fully grown at seven months of age. A dingo may live for up to ten\n        years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Wild dingoes are wary of humans and do not attack unless provoked. They\n        will approach camps in the bush looking for food or perhaps out of\n        curiosity. Dingoes can be kept as pets but should be obtained at a very\n        young age to enable them to bond with humans. Even when raised from pups\n        they never seem to lose their instinct for killing poultry or small\n        animals. Not all states in Australia allow dingoes to be kept as pets\n        and a permit is required. The export of dingoes is illegal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Dingoes and domestic dogs interbreed freely resulting in very few\n        pure-bred, southern or eastern Australia. This threatens the dingo's\n        ability to survive as a separate species. Public hostility is another\n        threat to the dingo. Because it takes some livestock, the dingo is\n        considered by many to be a pest.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Questions 1-8</h3>\n      <p>Answer the questions below.</p>\n      <p>\n        Choose <b>NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS</b> from the passage for each answer.\n      </p>\n      <ul style={{ listStyleType: \"none\" }}>\n        <li>\n          1.

Here, there are two main problems,\n        the eye mechanism has lost its original look, and it has a loose head.\n        We removed the mohair wig and removed the eye system. Then we separated\n        the head from the composition body and chemically cleaned the head,\n        removing old dirt, and wax, but not harming the original artwork. We\n        repaired the missing porcelain teeth by making duplicate porcelain teeth\n        to match and reinserted them. Then we took the original eye system and\n        reconditioned it. We then did the waxing of the eye mechanism and reset\n        the eyebar so the eyebar would open and close as it originally did.

Follow this hierarchy at\n        the top of the wealth pyramid: the richest 1 percent of adults alone\n        owned 40 percent of global assets in the year 2000; the richest 2\n        percent owned more than half of global household wealth, and the richest\n        10 percent of adults accounted for 85% of the world total. That leaves\n        very little for the remaining 90 percent of the global population. Could\n        it be any worse? Yes, the rich are still getting richer, more\n        millionaires are becoming billionaires.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As to the world's lower className: the bottom half of the world's adult\n        population owned barely 1 percent of global wealth, defined as net\n        worth: the value of physical and financial assets fewer debts. Over a\n        billion poor people subsist on less than one dollar a day. Every day,\n        according to UNICEF, 30,000 children die due to poverty - that's over 10\n        million children killed by poverty every year! Global economic apartheid\n        is killing people.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Here are data showing some of the variations among nations. Average\n        wealth amounted to $144,000 per person in the U.S. in 2000, not as good\n        as the $181,000 in Japan, but better than most others: $127,000 for the\n        U.K., $70,000 for Denmark, $37,000 for New Zealand, $1,400 in Indonesia\n        and $1,100 in India. Averages, of course, are very deceiving.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The statistical measure of inequality is the Gini value, which measures\n        inequality on a scale from zero (total equality) to one (complete\n        inequality). For income, it ranges from .35 to .45 in most countries.\n        Wealth inequality is usually much higher, typically between .65 and .75.\n        This reflects the greater difficulty in accumulating wealth (capital)\n        than increasing income. Two high wealth economies, Japan and the United\n        States show very different patterns of wealth inequality, with Japan\n        having a low wealth Gini of .55 and the U.S. having around .80. The\n        incomes of the top fifth of the Japanese population are only three times\n        that of the bottom fifth, compared to nine times in the U.S. Japan has\n        little economic apartheid compared to the U.S., yet both countries have\n        a huge number of wealthy people. Of the wealthiest 10 percent in the\n        world, 25 percent are American, and 20 percent are Japanese. These two\n        countries are even stronger among the richest 1 percent of individuals\n        in the world, with 37 percent residing in the U.S. and 27 percent in\n        Japan. The point is that despite high numbers of very wealthy people,\n        economic apartheid is absent in Japan and abysmal in the U.S\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1 - 7</h4>\n      <p>Complete the notes below.</p>\n      <p>\n        Write <b>NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/ OR A NUMBER</b> from the passage\n        for each answer.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          According to a UN report, the world’s wealth distribution is\n          drastically 1\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          In 2000, the wealthiest 1% had 40% of global wealth, while 10% owned 2\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          In contrast, just 1% of riches was shared by the 3\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" /> .\n        </li>\n        <li>More than a billion people survive on less than a dollar daily</li>\n        <li>\n          Poverty causes the death of more than 4\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" /> children annually.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Wealth imbalance among nations:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          In 2000, per capita wealth in Japan and America were $181,000 and $\n          144,000 respectively, but a mere $1100 in India.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Inequality is measured in terms of 5 <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n          , which ranges from 0 to 1.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Japan has less 6 <input className=\"optionClass\" /> than the U.S.\n          though both have a large number of very rich people.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Americans tend to save less, leading to less wealth accumulation.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The U.S. example indicates that more 7\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" /> can result in serious social\n          imbalance.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  `,\n  header14: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h2>Yes/no/not given Practice exercise</h2>\n      <p>\n        Answer questions <b>1-6</b> which are based on the reading passage\n        below.\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n        <b>Dependence On Technology Reading Passage</b>\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n        Reaching the moon, multiplying two 12 digit numbers instantly, searching\n        trillions of gigabytes of information at one go has all been made\n        possible due to technology. It has realized possibilities that would\n        have otherwise been considered a mammoth task to complete. Imagining a\n        life without technological devices in the vicinity is an unpleasant\n        thought for most people. But is the dependence desirable or does it have\n        its downside too?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In a survey conducted in the US, people were asked if society has become\n        dependent on technology. Out of the total responses, 77% of people\n        believed that dependence on technology has increased at an alarming\n        rate. According to a study, 6% of school-going teenagers in China are\n        addicted to the internet. In South Korea, the figures are likely to\n        reach 10%. These results are not surprising. Today, if teenagers are\n        asked the meaning of a particular word or to state their opinion on a\n        given issue, they will instantly reach for their mobile and the internet\n        instead of referring to a physical dictionary or a book for information.\n        Turning pages of physical books are relatively time-consuming, but it\n        does not necessarily mean that the much-trusted technology will always\n        be able to deliver better.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We have improved with technology, but we have not thought of an\n        alternative if technology does not work. The most recent examples are\n        the outages at the New York Stock Exchange when a break-down in the\n        system took three-and-half hours to resolve and resume trading, halting\n        the overall pace of Wall Street. Another such example is a minor router\n        issue at United Airlines which grounded its planes for two hours leading\n        to 800 flight delays. These are just a couple of the many incidents of a\n        technical outage. While the technology in use may be state-of-the-art,\n        having a reliable backup is equally important.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Sophisticated systems in various areas such as airlines, military, or\n        electric grids add to the convenience. However, there are inherent\n        risks. For example, even upgraded security systems may be vulnerable to\n        the slightest malfunction. A minor change in readings, codes, or chips\n        with malicious intent may harm innocent people and society at large.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Online networking, a gift of advanced technology, has become a part of\n        our daily lives and its advantages are undeniable. However, it has\n        changed our daily interactions and can change our social structure too.\n        Face-to-face meetings have been replaced by chats and text messages on\n        social media. Reduced face-to-face interaction has kept smartphone users\n        away from real-life situations. The virtual world cannot replace\n        real-life situations that demand communication skills, problem-solving\n        skills, tolerance, and receptivity to coexist in society. 'They don't\n        know how to handle conflict face to face because so many things happen\n        through some sort of technology,' said Melissa Ortega, a child\n        psychologist at New York's Child Mind Institute.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Technology has improved our way of life, but it should be used only as a\n        tool. Relying on it to an extent where a technological detox becomes\n        next to impossible is worrying.

The\n    timeframe for these changes is to be slowed or reversed. Changes to the Australian landscape have resulted in the\n    widespread and rapidly growing problem of dryland salinity. Farmers were among the first to be affected, by the\n    salinization of rivers and agricultural land. Biodiversity, as well as regional and urban infrastructure, such as\n    water supply, roads and buildings, are now also at risk. Two broad forms of salinity are recognized in Australia.\n    Primary or naturally occurring salinity is part of the Australian landscape and reflects the development of this\n    landscape over time. Examples are the marine plains found around the coastline of Australia and the salt lakes in\n    central and Western Australia. Salts are distributed widely across Australian landscapes. They originate mainly from\n    depositions of oceanic salt from rain and wind. Salt stored in the soil or groundwater is concentrated through\n    evaporation and transpiration by plants. In a healthy catchment, salt is slowly leached downwards and stored below\n    the root zone, or out of the system. Secondary salinity is the salinization of land and water resources due to land\n    use impacts by people. It includes salinity that results from water table rises from irrigation systems — irrigation\n    salinity, and from dryland management systems — dryland salinity. Both forms of salinity are due to accelerated\n    rising water tables mobilizing salt in the soil. There is no fundamental difference in the hydrologic process. Where\n    the water balance has been altered due to changing land use (e.g. clearing of native vegetation for broadacre\n    farming or grazing), the excess water entering the water table mobilizes salt which then rises to the land surface.\n    The movement of water drives salinization processes and may move the stored salt towards the soil surface or into\n    surface water bodies.</p>\n

One of the main purposes of a greenhouse is to grow\n          tomatoes, flowers and other plants that might struggle to grow\n          outside. A greenhouse stays warm inside, even during winter. Sunlight\n          shines in and warms the plants and air inside. But the heat is trapped\n          by the glass and cannot escape. So during the daylight hours, it gets\n          warmer and warmer inside a greenhouse, and stays quite warm at night\n          too.\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <strong>B.</strong>\n        <span>\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"i\">i</option>\n            <option value=\"ii\">ii</option>\n            <option value=\"iii\">iii</option>\n            <option value=\"v\">v</option>\n          </select>\n          The Earth experiences a similar thing to a greenhouse. Gases in the\n          atmosphere such as carbon dioxide do what the roof of a greenhouse\n          does. During the day, the Sun shines through the atmosphere. Earth’s\n          surface warms up in the sunlight. At night, Earth’s surface cools,\n          releasing the heat back into the air. But some of the heat is trapped\n          by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is what keeps our\n          Earth a warm and comfortable 59 degrees Fahrenheit, on average.\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <strong>C.</strong>\n        <span>\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"i\">i</option>\n            <option value=\"ii\">ii</option>\n            <option value=\"iii\">iii</option>\n            <option value=\"v\">v</option>\n          </select>\n          However, gas molecules, called greenhouse gases, that absorb thermal\n          infrared radiation, and are in significant enough quantity, can force\n          and alter the climate system.

In Josef Werne’s opinion, an associate professor\n          at the department of geology & planetary science at the University of\n          Pittsburgh told Live Science, we have three options. Firstly to do\n          nothing and live with the consequences. Secondly, to adapt to the\n          changing climate (which includes things like rising sea level and\n          related flooding). Thirdly, mitigate the impact of climate change by\n          aggressively enacting policies that actually reduce the concentration\n          of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n        </span>\n      </div>\n      <button className=\"q-a\">\n        <b>Answers</b>\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  `,\n  header3: `\n  <div className=\"header2Class\">\n  <h3>Locating Information Practice Exercise</h3>\n  <p></p>Answer questions 1-6 which are based on the reading passage below.\n  <h3>Incredible Journeys Reading Passage</h3>\n  <div>\n    <strong>A.</strong>\n    <span>\n      The nervous system of the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis, with around\n      100,000 neurons, is about 1 millionth the size of a human brain. Yet,\n      in the featureless deserts of Tunisia, this ant can venture over 100\n      meters from its nest to find food without becoming lost. Imagine\n      randomly wandering 20 kilometres in the open desert, your tracks\n      obliterated by the wind, then turning around and making a beeline to\n      your starting point - and no GPS allowed! That's the equivalent of\n      what the desert ant accomplishes with its scant neural resources. How\n      does it do it?\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>B</strong>\n    <span>\n      Jason, a graduate student studying the development of human and animal\n      cognition, discusses a remarkable series of experiments on the desert\n      ant on his blog, The Thoughtful Animal. In work spanning more than 30\n      years, researchers from Rüdiger Wehner's laboratory at the University\n      of Zurich Institute of Zoology carefully tracked the movements of ants\n      in the desert as the insects foraged for food. One of the researchers'\n      key questions was how the ants calculated the direction to their nest.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>C</strong>\n    <span>\n      To check for the possibility that the ants used landmarks as visual\n      cues, despite the relatively featureless desert landscape, the\n      researchers engaged in a bit of trickery. They placed a food source at\n      a distance from a nest, then tracked the nest's ants until the ants\n      found the food. Once the food was found, the ants were relocated from\n      that point so that the way back to their nest was a different\n      direction than it would have been otherwise. The relocated ants walked\n      away from the nest, in the same direction they should have walked if\n      they had never been moved. This suggested that the ants are not\n      following features, but orienting themselves relative to an internal\n      navigation system or (as turned out to be the case) the position of\n      the Sun in the sky.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>D</strong>\n    <span>\n      No matter how convoluted a route the ants take to find the food, they\n      always return in a straight-line path, heading directly home. The\n      researchers discovered the ants navigation system isn't perfect, small\n      errors arise depending on how circuitous their initial route was. But\n      the ants account for these errors as well, by walking in a corrective\n      zigzag pattern as they approach the nest. So how do the ants know how\n      far to travel? It could still be that they are visually tracking the\n      distance they walk. The researchers tested this by painting over the\n      ants' eyes for their return trip, but the ants still walked the\n      correct distance, indicating that the ants are not using sight to\n      measure their journeys.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>E</strong>\n    <span>\n      Another possibility is that the ants simply count their steps. In a\n      remarkable experiment published in Science in 2006, scientists\n      painstakingly attached 'stilts' made of pig hairs to some of the ants'\n      legs, while other ants had their legs clipped, once they had reached\n      their food target. If the ants counted their steps on the journey out,\n      then the newly short-legged ants should stop short of the nest, while\n      stilted ants should walk past it. Indeed, this is what occurred! Ants\n      count their steps to track their location. (If only you had remembered\n      to do this before you started on your 20-kilometre desert trek!)\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>F</strong>\n    <span>\n      But other creatures have different navigation puzzles to solve. In a\n      separate post, Jason explains a study showing how maternal gerbils\n      find their nests. When a baby is removed from the nest, the gerbil\n      mother naturally tries to find and retrieve it. Researchers placed one\n      of the babies in a cup at the centre of a platform, shrouded in\n      darkness. When the mother found the baby, the platform was rotated.\n      Did she head for the new position of her nest, with its scents and\n      sounds of crying babies? No, she went straight to the spot where the\n      nest had been, ignoring all these other cues. For gerbils, relying on\n      the internal representation of their environment normally suffices, so\n      the other information goes unheeded.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>G</strong>\n    <span>\n      Migratory birds, on the other hand, must navigate over much larger\n      distances, some of them returning to the identical geographic spot\n      year after year. How do they manage this trick? One component,\n      University of Auckland researcher and teacher Fabiana Kubke reports,\n      is the ability to detect the Earth's magnetic field. Though we've\n      known about this avian sixth sense for some time, the location of a\n      bird's magnetic detector is still somewhat of a mystery. Last\n      November, however, a team led by Manuela Zapka published a letter in\n      Nature that narrowed the possibilities. Migratory European Robins have\n      magnetic material in their beaks, but also molecules called\n      cryptochromes in the back of their eyes that might be used as a sort\n      of compass. The team systematically cut the connections between these\n      two areas and the Robins' brains, finding that the ability to orient\n      to compass points was only disturbed when the connection to\n      cryptochromes was disrupted.\n    </span>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <strong>H</strong>\n    <span>\n      Much remains to be learned about how birds can successfully migrate\n      over long distances. Unlike ants and gerbils, they can easily correct\n      for large displacements in location and return to the correct spot.\n    </span>\n    <div>\n      <h3>Questions 1- 6</h3>\n      <p>\n        This reading passage has eight paragraphs, <b>A–H.</b>\n      </p>\n      <p>Which paragraph contains the following information?</p>\n      <p>\n        Write the correct letter, <b>A - H</b>, as your answer to each\n        question.\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            An explanation of how adjustments are made when navigating\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            Recent news about how navigation systems work\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            A comparison of tracking abilities\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            A study showing that scent and sound are not important\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            Explaining the importance of counting\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span>\n            A description of how ants navigate\n            <select className=\"optionClass\">\n              <option value=\"A\">A</option>\n              <option value=\"B\">B</option>\n              <option value=\"C\">C</option>\n              <option value=\"D\">D</option>\n              <option value=\"E\">E</option>\n              <option value=\"F\">F</option>\n              <option value=\"G\">G</option>\n              <option value=\"H\">H</option>\n            </select>\n          </span>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n`,\n  header4: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h1>True False Not Given Practice Exercise</h1>\n      <p>\n        Answer questions <b>1-7</b> which are based on the reading passage\n        below.\n      </p>\n      <h2>A Secret Well Kept Reading Passage</h2>\n      <p>\n        Political leaders in the days before the internet and 24-hour cable news\n        were not subjected to the intense media scrutiny that their modern\n        counterparts face. It was possible to rise to power and stay in office\n        despite having skeletons in the closet that would now see one disgraced\n        in a scandal. One of the best examples of keeping damaging secrets from\n        the public was Canadian Prime Minister, Lyon Mackenzie King, (almost\n        always referred to as Mackenzie King).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Mackenzie King was born in 1874 with the proverbial silver spoon. He\n        accumulated five university degrees, including a PhD from Harvard in\n        economics, a subject he went on to teach at that institute. In addition\n        to being a professor and an economist, King was a lawyer and a\n        journalist. He was also a civil servant and was appointed as Canada's\n        first Minister of Labour. He was elected to Parliament as a Liberal and\n        would go on to become Canada’s, and the Commonwealth's longest-serving\n        prime minister, serving for nearly 22 years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Mackenzie King cut his political teeth as a labour negotiator. He was\n        successful in part because he mastered the art of conciliation.\n        Conciliation, along with half measures, would become his trademark. 'Do\n        nothing by halves that can be done by quarters,” one detractor wrote of\n        him. And so, King sought the middle ground in order to keep the\n        country’s many factions together. He would go out of his way to avoid\n        debate and was fond of saying 'Parliament will decide,' when pressed for\n        an answer. He was pudgy, plodding, wooden and cold, and his speeches\n        were slumber-inducing. Unloved, but practical and astute, he has been\n        called Canada's greatest prime minister. He created old age pensions,\n        unemployment insurance, and family allowance, and he left the country in\n        much better shape than when he inherited it.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Mackenzie King died in 1950, thus passing into the mildly-interesting\n        annals of Canadian history. Then, during the seventies, his diaries (all\n        30,000 pages of them) were published, and millions of Canadian jaws\n        dropped. It turns out that King, that monotonous embodiment of\n        Presbyterian morals, was a dedicated occultist who communicated with the\n        dead, including his mother (who he revered), former President Roosevelt,\n        Leonardo da Vinci, and his dogs. And he did this almost every evening\n        for the last 25 years of his life.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        King used a Ouija board and owned a crystal ball. He read tea leaves. He\n        employed mediums and consulted a psychic. He visited palmists. He was a\n        numerologist, always sensitive to what the numbers 7 and 17 were\n        attempting to reveal to him. He thought that when he looked at the clock\n        and found both hands in alignment, someone from the other side must have\n        been watching over him. King was careful not to reveal any of his\n        'psychical research' to the public, his departed mother having warned\n        him that people wouldn't understand.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        (Adapted from a passage in 'A Sort of Homecoming - In Search of Canada'\n        by Troy Parfitt)\n      </p>\n      <h3>Questions 1-7</h3>\n      <p>\n        Do the following statements agree with the information given in the\n        reading passage?\n      </p>\n      <p>Write</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <b>TRUE</b>\n          <span> if the statement agrees with the information</span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <b>FALSE</b>\n          <span> if the statement contradicts the information</span>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <b>NOT GIVEN</b>\n          <span> if there is no information on this in the passage</span>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          Mackenzie King came from a privileged background.\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"true\">true</option>\n            <option value=\"false\">false</option>\n            <option value=\"not given\">Not Given</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          He taught economics at Harvard University.\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"true\">true</option>\n            <option value=\"false\">false</option>\n            <option value=\"not given\">Not Given</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Mackenzie King was known for his stubbornness and extreme political\n          views..\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"true\">true</option>\n            <option value=\"false\">false</option>\n            <option value=\"not given\">Not Given</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Mackenzie was not liked by his people and did nothing for their\n          welfare.\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"true\">true</option>\n            <option value=\"false\">false</option>\n            <option value=\"not given\">Not Given</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          His diaries were published when he was in his seventies.\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"true\">true</option>\n            <option value=\"false\">false</option>\n            <option value=\"not given\">Not Given</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          He communicated with dead political leaders to get their advice on\n          handling problems.\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"true\">true</option>\n            <option value=\"false\">false</option>\n            <option value=\"not given\">Not Given</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          He regarded seeing the hands of a clock together as an auspicious\n          sign.\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"true\">true</option>\n            <option value=\"false\">false</option>\n            <option value=\"not given\">Not Given</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n    </div>`,\n  header5: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h2>Multiple Choice Questions Practice Exercise</h2>\n      <p>\n        Answer questions <b>1-5</b> which are based on the reading passage\n        below.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Travel is the best form of education Reading Passage</h3>\n      <p>\n        One learns a lot while serving in the United States Army. Foreing\n        places, stressful conditions, and absence from home can foster an\n        out-of-the-classroom education that crosses the boundary of the odd and\n        unusual. Today, tales of strange sea creatures and haunted islands seem\n        like a bad Sci-Fi marathon. But these were realities for one U.S. Army\n        soldier stationed overseas at the thrun of the 20th century.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The art of journal keeping, letter writing and daily diary entries are\n        becoming extinct as methods of memory management are changing in today's\n        technology driven world. What once was detailed on paper with memory\n        fresh at hand is now posted on YouTube Today, blogs replace diary\n        entries. Hand-written letters to loved ones are far slower than a quick\n        Facebook 'poke' or a cell phone text message.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Historians enjoy a deep appreciation for the written word. They savour\n        the ability to see the world through the eyes of someone who never had\n        satellite TV, the Internet or cell phone. Where explanation was not\n        readily at hand in the strange lands of the Philippine Islands, the\n        environment was ripe for adventure and the unknown. Placing one's self\n        in such situations fosters an education that cannot be duplicated in any\n        classroom, book or blockbuster movie. A survivor of deadly and savage\n        situations, Colonel Horace P. Hoobs recorded these well-documented\n        experiences that lend a degree of depth to the retelling and\n        re-imagining of Army history.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The odd education of Colonel Horace P. Hobbs is revealed in his\n        voluminous personal papers held at the U.S. Army Military History\n        Institute. A letter of August 16, 1918, soothes his wife while he is\n        stationed in France during World War I. 'You see it is the women who\n        suffer most during a war. Now I know you and mother are worrying about\n        me and I am living in the most luxurious comfort and perfect safety just\n        now.' He goes to great lengths to explain his lush surroundings and the\n        comfort he is experiencing, from bathing in a nearby brook to the size\n        of his room and the servants who provide for him, as he attempts to\n        console a worry-sick wife. It would seem, however, that Mrs Hobbs had\n        been through worse as a military spouse.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Her husband was stationed in the Philippines during the insurrection\n        from 1899 to 1901. Colonel Hobbs wrote a book from his collected\n        journals and memoirs entitled, 'Kris and Krag: Adventures among the\n        Moros of the Southern Philippine Islands'. Among his many tales, the\n        Colonel tells about a strange native custom on one of the small islands\n        of taking their boats across a narrow strait to another island and\n        returning before dark. They explained to him that the island was the\n        home of the 'wok-wok', a powerful ghost who must be appeased with gifts\n        of rice so they will not harm the people. Upon further inspection, the\n        Army discovered the 'wok-wok’ to be large apes.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Another bizarre chapter in the Colonel's education came when he was\n        asked by some villagers to kill a sea creature which wreaked havoc among\n        the people whenever they Slaughtered an animal for food. The blood would\n        run into the water, and out would come the creature. The Colonel waited\n        for the apparition to appear after a slaughter, and he was not\n        disappointed. Upon further inspection he described the animal as being\n        some kind of mix between an alligator and a crocodile, but one he had\n        never seen before.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Experience in foreign places, blended with curiosity and a desire to\n        learn, enabled Colon to obtain a far greater grasp of the world. These\n        traits provided him with an education that the average person today\n        cannot obtain from watching television or searching the web.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Questions 1-5</h3>\n      <p>Choose the correct letter, a, b, c or d.</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li className=\"optionClass\">\n          What offers a non-traditional form of education?\n          <ul>\n            <li> a.

The objects in these museums were\n        displayed in Cabinets of Curiosities, also called Cabinets of Wonder or\n        Wonder Rooms. The word “cabinet” was then used to describe a room and\n        not a piece of furniture. The oldest recorded example of such was the\n        Ennigaldi Nanna’s museum that was located in Mesopotamia. It was founded\n        in 530 BC.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Before the 18th century, only elite or respectable members of society,\n        by the standards of that era, could visit museums with permission from\n        the owner and the staff. The first museums to be opened for the general\n        public were the British Museum in London in 1759 and the Uffizi Gallery\n        in Florence in 1765. However, even though they were no longer exclusive\n        places, only people from the middle and upper className were privileged\n        with a written permission request. Also, the visitations were often\n        limited to a few hours. The first public museum in its true sense was\n        the Louvre in Paris which was opened in 1793 to people of any status and\n        age, emerging as an agent of nationalistic fervor.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, societies began to\n        regard museums as centers of the production of new knowledge. Historical\n        museums shifted focus to display scientific discoveries and artistic\n        developments with collections that could be useful for research also.\n        Over the twentieth century, as cities increased in size, wealth, and\n        population, more museums developed. These were shaped by the public\n        response to education and entertainment. Greater funding was directed\n        towards the development of modern museums. Study programs dedicated to\n        the field of art and culture were created to promote the growth of\n        museums, and activities such as the collection and preservation of\n        artifacts such as paintings or sculptures had consequently become more\n        organized. Even wealthy industrialists such as Henry Ford and Henry\n        Mercer contributed their collections leading to the development of more\n        privately run museums.\n      </p>\n      <b>Part B</b>\n      <p>\n        A breeze of change was once again felt in the early 21st century.\n        Museums were no longer anchored to the national ideal and today’s new\n        museums attract intellectuals as well as tourists and students.\n        Attitudes toward museums have become more favorable as people no longer\n        view them as boring, cold places that drag you to the past.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        One of the main factors that have contributed to this is technology.\n        Modern museums have embraced technology with considerable use of\n        multimedia, digital displays, touch screens as well as other interactive\n        technologies. Some museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in\n        New York, use technology that allows visitors to see the objects, hear\n        or read about the collection on their smartphones by scanning the\n        artwork. Other national museums have also followed suit by embracing\n        mobile interactivity. The Smithsonian Institution, which is the world’s\n        largest museum and research complex containing 19 museums and galleries,\n        provides cell phone tours, interactive games like Pheon, which is a\n        multimedia scavenger hunt game, multilingual slideshows, and even\n        augmented reality apps such as one from the postal museum showing Owney,\n        the mascot of the Railway Mail Service.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Additionally, there are some museums such as the National Museum of\n        African Art that have the Artists in Dialogue 2 app, which allows for\n        visual calls and responses that cut across physical and political\n        borders. The app facilitates a guided tour of the museum with the\n        curator virtually, and also allows the user to experiment with the\n        artistic technique in a virtual art-development game. The user can even\n        communicate with active groups of the museum on social media.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So far, technology has provided modern-day museums with the opportunity\n        to share images and works of art with more people than ever before.\n        However, the conclusion is that technology is enhancing and not\n        replacing the brick and mortar museums since technology cannot replace a\n        live experience for the viewer such as live interaction with the\n        experts, emotional reactions, and the physicality of artworks.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1 - 5</h4>\n      <p>Complete the summary below.</p>\n      <p>\n        Write <i>ONE WORD ONLY</i> from <b>Part A</b> of the passage for each\n        answer.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The earliest museums displayed personal 1\n        <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n        belonging to rich people, and until the eighteenth century, only the\n        elite className could visit these places.

The first, the\n        reaction stage, is when a glass beaker is placed on top of a tripod, and\n        20cm of dilute sulphuric acid poured into it. The acid is then heated.\n        When it is almost boiling, a small quantity of copper oxide powder is\n        added to the beaker. The mixture is then stirred with a glass spatula\n        until the copper oxide has dissolved. This process is then repeated\n        until 1g of powder has been added to the sulphuric acid. The heat is\n        then removed from the beaker and the solution allowed to cool. The\n        second stage is the filtration stage and, as the name suggests, is where\n        a filter and conical flask are used to remove any copper oxide that has\n        not reacted. A clear copper sulphate solution will be left in the glass\n        dish. The third stage is where heat is applied to the copper sulphate\n        solution in order to concentrate the solution: the concentration stage.\n        The final crystallization stage happens when the solution begins to\n        cool, and pure copper sulphate crystals start to form.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1 – 6</h4>\n      <p>\n        The diagram below shows how copper sulphate can be made using simple\n        laboratory equipment.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Choose <b>NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS</b> from the reading passage for each\n        answer.\n      </p>\n      <p>Label the diagram.</p>\n      <h1>Paragraph</h1>\n      <textarea id=\"editor\" className=\"optionClass\"></textarea>\n    </div>`,\n  header8: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h2>Matching Sentence Endings Practice Exercise</h2>\n      <p>Answer questions 1-5 which are based on the reading passage below.</p>\n      <h3>\n        <b>The Penny Black Reading Passage</b>\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n        In 1840, the United Kingdom introduced the penny black, the first\n        adhesive postage stamp issued anywhere in the world.For many years the\n        postal service in the U.K. had been a very expensive service for\n        ordinary people to use. The costs were prohibitive, a single letter\n        sometimes costing a working person’s full day’s wage. The postal system\n        also had many strange anomalies, such as certain categories of mail\n        going free (and therefore being paid for by the charges on others),\n        newspapers going for nothing, most mail being paid for by the addressee\n        rather than by the sender, and so on.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There were moves for postal reform for many years, until eventually\n        these moves started gathering some force through the attention of many,\n        amongst whom Rowland Hill is the best known, and Robert Wallace, MP for\n        Greenock, was instrumental.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The story is long and involved, but eventually, The Penny Postage Bill\n        was passed by Parliament on 17 August 1839. Some basic elements of the\n        plan were the lowering of postage rates for basic letters to one penny,\n        the removal of certain idiosyncrasies, that prepayment would become\n        normal, and the availability of printed envelopes, letter sheets, and\n        labels to show prepayment. The “labels” were the penny black and\n        twopence blue.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A bookseller and printer from Dundee, James Chalmers, holds a strong\n        claim to be the actual inventor of the adhesive postage stamp. He is\n        said to have been interested in postal reform from about 1822, and to\n        have printed samples of his idea for printed gummed labels in August\n        1834. It seems that, although Hill also presented the idea of adhesive\n        stamps, he was probably keener on the use of standard prepaid letter\n        folders, such as were issued in 1840 using a design by William Mulready.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The new stamps went on sale on 1st May 1840 and were valid for postage\n        from 6th May 1840 (although some were used during the 1st-5th May\n        period). The Mulreadies were issued at the same time. Public reaction to\n        these new items was quite the opposite to Rowland Hill’s expectations.\n        The labels were well-received and admired; the Mulready design was\n        lambasted and ridiculed. Initial supplies of the stamps were rushed\n        through the printing and distribution process, but supplies soon caught\n        up with requirements.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The stamps were printed in sheets of 240, engraved on steel plates, on\n        gummed paper with a single small crown watermark on each stamp. Eleven\n        different printing plates were used, and it is possible in almost every\n        case to work out which plate any individual stamp was printed from by a\n        few characteristics. Things like the positioning of the corner letters\n        within their squares, the presence of the “O flaw”, which rays of the\n        stars in the upper corners are broken at what points, and so on, can\n        point to a correct plate identification, but more specialised literature\n        is required in order to do this. Some plates are scarcer than others,\n        plate 11 being the scarcest.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Every penny black stamp has letters in the lower two corners. These\n        simply identify what sheet position the stamp occupied. When the\n        printing plates were produced the lower squares were blank, and the\n        letters were punched in by hand. The left square letter shows which\n        horizontal row the stamp was in – the first row being A, the second B,\n        and so on down to the twentieth row with T. The right square letter\n        indicates the vertical column, again with A for the first column, B, C,\n        and so on across to L for the last (twelfth) column. It should be noted\n        therefore that each letter combination is just as common or as scarce as\n        any other.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        There were 68,158,080 penny blacks issued (yes, 68 million!), and even\n        with only a 2% survival rate, there are likely to be about 1.3 million\n        still in existence. The survival rate may well be considerably higher\n        than 2%, as it should be remembered that in 1840 the use of envelopes\n        was unusual, most letters being written, folded, and sealed with sealing\n        wax; this meant that whenever a letter was filed in a lawyer’s office,\n        bank, etc., the whole thing would be kept – letter and outer cover\n        including the adhesive stamp.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        From the collector's perspective, the physical condition of the stamp –\n        any fault such as a thin, tear, crease, or stain will lower the value,\n        and the number, size, and regularity of the margins make a big\n        difference to value. The stamps were not perforated and had to be\n        separated using scissors or a knife. As there was only about 1mm between\n        one stamp and another, it was very easy to stray just a little and cut\n        into the printed design of the stamp. A stamp with two full margins and\n        perhaps a couple of other part margins is about average. Collectors will\n        pay higher prices for examples with four good, wide, and even margins.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1-5</h4>\n      <p>Complete each sentence with the correct ending, A–G, below.</p>\n      <p>\n        <i>Write the correct letter, A-G, as your answer to each question. </i>\n      </p>\n      <ul style={{ listStyleType: \"none\" }}>\n        <li>\n          1 After reforms, most mails was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          2 Each steel printing plate was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          3 Every penny black was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          4 Putting a letter in an envelope was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          5 Keeping the borders of each stamp was\n          <select className=\"optionClass\">\n            <option value=\"a\">A</option>\n            <option value=\"b\">B</option>\n            <option value=\"c\">C</option>\n            <option value=\"d\">D</option>\n            <option value=\"e\">E</option>\n            <option value=\"f\">F</option>\n            <option value=\"g\">G</option>\n          </select>\n        </li>\n        <li>A Unusual in 1840.</li>\n        <li>B Able to print sheets of 240 stamps.</li>\n        <li>C Paid for by the sender.</li>\n        <li>D Very difficult to achieve.</li>\n        <li>E Very expensive to send.</li>\n        <li>F Designed with two letters in the bottom corners.</li>\n        <li>G Quickly accepted.</li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>`,\n  header9: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h2>Matching features Practice Exercise</h2>\n      <p>\n        <i>\n          Answer questions 1-7 which are based on the reading passage below.\n        </i>\n      </p>\n      <h3>Objects From Different Civilizations Reading Passage</h3>\n      <p>\n        Objects from lost civilisations can tell us about the social\n        relationships and the way of life of the people belonging to those\n        societies. The Indus valley civilisation and the Chinese civilisation\n        have been influential with their innovations and contributions to\n        advanced technology. The Indus Valley civilization is also called the\n        Harappan civilization. Developing along the mighty Indus River, it was\n        at its peak around 2500 and 3500 BC. This Bronze Age civilisation is\n        believed to be among the oldest world civilisations together with the\n        Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations. The famous figurine of the\n        dancing girl from the Harappa region shows the advances made in art and\n        metallurgy at the time. The statue describes details such as the\n        hairstyle and ornaments prevalent then such as the more than 20 bangles\n        in her left arm and four on her right arm, and the necklace. Although\n        the bronze statuette is in standing position, it was named the dancing\n        girl by assuming that it was her profession.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The seals are other famous objects from the Bronze Age. Seals are\n        beautifully carved out of stone and then fired for durability. Over\n        3,500 seals discovered are mostly square with different symbols at the\n        top, an animal in the centre and a few more symbols at the bottom are,\n        which are presumed to be the inscription of the Indus valley language.\n        The inscription indicates that people of this age wrote the first line\n        from right to left, the second line from left to right and so on. Some\n        common animal inscriptions on these seals include elephants, unicorns,\n        rhinoceros, and bulls. On the reverse face, most seals have projections\n        with a hole to possibly carry it comfortably. The imprint on some of the\n        seals suggests that they were used as clay tags for sacks of traded\n        goods such as grain, which means that the Harappan people were involved\n        in long-distance trading networks. Hunting tools show that the Indus\n        people were fond of game. Many of the toys are carts and animals made\n        from baked clay, and most were for children, which has led to the\n        conclusion that the people had an active social life.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Standardised measurement is another valuable contribution of the Indus\n        valley people. The oldest ruler with markings was a copper alloy rod\n        found by a German archaeologist and he claims that it was used as a\n        standard measurement unit. He mentions that the measurements on the\n        ruler are divided into units that correspond to 1.32 inches which are\n        further divided into perfectly calculated decimal subdivisions.\n        Measurements of the bricks found in excavations of the Mohenjo Daro and\n        Harappan civilisations match with those on the ruler mentioned by the\n        German archaeologist.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        China was the first nation to invent paper. In the older civilisations,\n        words were written on natural materials such as grass stalks, earthen\n        plates, wood and bamboo strips, tree leaves, and sheepskins. The first\n        paper from the Chinese people was known as bo and was made of silk.\n        However, it was expensive. In the 2nd century, a new kind of paper was\n        produced from rags, bark, wheat stalks, and other materials, which was\n        not only cheaper but was also durable and could be used for brush\n        writing. Papermaking had spread to other parts of the world in the\n        beginning of the third century. Ancient China also gets credit for the\n        invention of gunpowder. In a collection of most important military\n        techniques as described in Wujing Zongyao that was edited in 1044 by\n        Zeng Gong Liang, three formulas of making gunpowder were discovered and\n        have been described as the earliest formulas of such kinds. Another\n        significant gift from China was the compass. It was developed after some\n        miners got hold of a piece of a natural magnetite that attracted iron\n        and pointed north. The compass that we use today is a result of a series\n        of improvements to the earliest design. Before it was invented,\n        navigators depended on the position of the moon, sun, and the polestar\n        for their bearings.\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1-7</h4>\n      <p>\n        <i>\n

which are based on the reading passage\n        below.\n      </p>\n      <h3>The Halifax Explosion Reading Passage</h3>\n      <p>\n        Before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, the\n        largest-ever non-natural explosion had taken place in 1917 in the\n        eastern Canadian port city of Halifax. With the outbreak of World War I,\n        Halifax was effectively transformed into a boomtown. Convoys gathered\n        weekly in Bedford Basin (the north-western end of Halifax Harbour) in\n        order to traverse the Atlantic, and Halifax Harbour became heavy with\n        vessels of one variety or another. This spike in boat traffic was not\n        dealt with efficiently, and collisions became almost normal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        On December 1st, 1917, the French vessel Mont Blanc left New York in\n        order to join a convoy in Halifax after being loaded with 226,797\n        kilograms of TNT (an explosive), 223,188 kilograms of benzol (a type of\n        gasoline), 1,602,519 kilograms of wet picric acid (an explosive), and\n        544,311 kilograms of dry picric acid (another explosive). On December\n        6th, the Mont Blanc was ushered into Halifax’s harbour after the U-boat\n        nets had been raised.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At the same time, the cargoless Norwegian ship, Imo, left Bedford Basin\n        en route to New York in order to pick up relief items for transport to\n        war-torn Belgium. Imo was behind schedule and attempting to remedy that.\n        She passed a boat on the wrong side before sending a tugboat retreating\n        to port. By the time she reached the Narrows, she was in the wrong\n        channel and going too fast. The Mont Blanc sounded her whistle, but the\n        Imo sounded back twice, refusing to alter course. At the last moment,\n        the Mont Blanc veered, and the Imo reversed, but it was too late. From\n        the gash formed in the French boat’s hull seeped a noxious spiral of\n        oily, orange-dappled smoke. Mont Blanc’s crew rowed to shore on the\n        Dartmouth side, but no one could decipher their warnings. Their fiery\n        vessel then casually drifted toward the Halifax side where it came to\n        rest against one of the piers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        This spectacle drew thousands of onlookers. People crowded docks and\n        windows filled with curious faces. As many as 1,600 died instantly when\n        the boat exploded. Around 9,000 were injured, 6,000 seriously so.\n        Approximately 12,000 buildings were severely damaged; virtually every\n        building in town was damaged to some extent; 1,630 were rendered\n        nonexistent.

It sent up a column of smoke reckoned to be\n        7,000 metres in height. It was felt more than 480 kilometres away. It\n        flung a ship gun barrel some 5.5 kilometres, and part of an anchor,\n        which weighed 517 kilograms, around 3 kilometres. The blast absolutely\n        flattened a district known as Richmond. It also caused a tsunami that\n        saw a wave 18 metres above the high-water mark depositing the Imo onto\n        the shore of the Dartmouth side.

Consequently, many of those\n        trapped within collapsed structures died of exposure.

It is not truly native to Australia but is thought\n        to have arrived between 3,500 and 4,000 years ago. Whatever its origins,\n        the dingo was a highly valued companion to the aborigines. They were\n        hunting companions, guard dogs, and they kept them warm at night.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Some believe they were brought here on rafts or boats by the ancestral\n        aborigines. It has also been suggested that they came with Indonesian or\n        South-East Asian fishermen who visited the northern coast of Australia.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo can be found in all areas of Australia - from harsh deserts to\n        lush rainforest The highly adaptable dingo is found in every habitat and\n        every state of Australia,except Tasmania. In deserts, access to drinking\n        water determines where the animal can live. Purebred dingo numbers in\n        the wild are declining as man encroaches deeper and deeper into\n        wilderness areas, often accompanied by his domestic dog.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo is different from the modern dog in several ways: it does not\n        bark, it has a different gait, and its ears are always erect. Dingoes\n        are naturally lean, and they are usually cream to reddish-yellow with\n        white points, some are black with tan points. An adult dingo stands more\n        than 60cm high and weighs about 15kg. It is slightly smaller than a\n        German Shepherd.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In its natural state, the dingo lives either alone or in a small group,\n        unlike many other wild dog species which may form packs. Dingoes have a\n        clearly defined territory which they rarely leave and which they protect\n        from other dingoes, but which may be shared with dingoes when they form\n        a group to hunt larger prey. The size of the home territory varies\n        according to the food supply. Dingoes hunt mainly at night. Groups are\n        controlled by dominant male. Members of a group maintain contact by\n        marking rocks and trees within the territory, and by howling,\n        particularly in the breeding season.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo's diet consists of native mammals, including kangaroos,\n        although domestic animals and some farm stock are also on the menu. This\n        makes the animal unpopular with farmers. The dingo is thought to have\n        contributed to the mainland extinction of the thylacine through\n        increased competition for food.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The dingo is an intelligent animal. It is no more dangerous to man than\n        any other feral dog. The natural prey of the dingo is small mammals and\n        ground-dwelling birds, but with the introduction of white settlement,\n        they became such a menace to sheep, calves and poultry that measures had\n        to be taken in an attempt to control them, such as dog-proof fences.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Dingoes start breeding when they reach the age of one or two but only\n        the dominant members within an established group breed. They breed only\n        once a year. Mating usually occurs in autumn/early winter, and after a\n        gestation of nine weeks (same as domestic dogs), a litter averaging 4-5\n        pups is born, which are reared in a hollow log, a rock-shelter, or an\n        old rabbit warren. Both parents take part in raising the pups. The pups\n        are fully grown at seven months of age. A dingo may live for up to ten\n        years.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Wild dingoes are wary of humans and do not attack unless provoked. They\n        will approach camps in the bush looking for food or perhaps out of\n        curiosity. Dingoes can be kept as pets but should be obtained at a very\n        young age to enable them to bond with humans. Even when raised from pups\n        they never seem to lose their instinct for killing poultry or small\n        animals. Not all states in Australia allow dingoes to be kept as pets\n        and a permit is required. The export of dingoes is illegal.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Dingoes and domestic dogs interbreed freely resulting in very few\n        pure-bred, southern or eastern Australia. This threatens the dingo's\n        ability to survive as a separate species. Public hostility is another\n        threat to the dingo. Because it takes some livestock, the dingo is\n        considered by many to be a pest.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Questions 1-8</h3>\n      <p>Answer the questions below.</p>\n      <p>\n        Choose <b>NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS</b> from the passage for each answer.\n      </p>\n      <ul style={{ listStyleType: \"none\" }}>\n        <li>\n          1.

They will find a beautiful antique doll that does not look as\n        beautiful as it should, but with proper restoration, she can be as\n        beautiful as the day she was created. Here, there are two main problems,\n        the eye mechanism has lost its original look, and it has a loose head.\n        We removed the mohair wig and removed the eye system. Then we separated\n        the head from the composition body and chemically cleaned the head,\n        removing old dirt, and wax, but not harming the original artwork. We\n        repaired the missing porcelain teeth by making duplicate porcelain teeth\n        to match and reinserted them. Then we took the original eye system and\n        reconditioned it. We then did the waxing of the eye mechanism and reset\n        the eyebar so the eyebar would open and close as it originally did.

Follow this hierarchy at\n        the top of the wealth pyramid: the richest 1 percent of adults alone\n        owned 40 percent of global assets in the year 2000; the richest 2\n        percent owned more than half of global household wealth, and the richest\n        10 percent of adults accounted for 85% of the world total. That leaves\n        very little for the remaining 90 percent of the global population. Could\n        it be any worse? Yes, the rich are still getting richer, more\n        millionaires are becoming billionaires.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        As to the world's lower className: the bottom half of the world's adult\n        population owned barely 1 percent of global wealth, defined as net\n        worth: the value of physical and financial assets fewer debts. Over a\n        billion poor people subsist on less than one dollar a day. Every day,\n        according to UNICEF, 30,000 children die due to poverty - that's over 10\n        million children killed by poverty every year! Global economic apartheid\n        is killing people.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Here are data showing some of the variations among nations. Average\n        wealth amounted to $144,000 per person in the U.S. in 2000, not as good\n        as the $181,000 in Japan, but better than most others: $127,000 for the\n        U.K., $70,000 for Denmark, $37,000 for New Zealand, $1,400 in Indonesia\n        and $1,100 in India. Averages, of course, are very deceiving.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The statistical measure of inequality is the Gini value, which measures\n        inequality on a scale from zero (total equality) to one (complete\n        inequality). For income, it ranges from .35 to .45 in most countries.\n        Wealth inequality is usually much higher, typically between .65 and .75.\n        This reflects the greater difficulty in accumulating wealth (capital)\n        than increasing income. Two high wealth economies, Japan and the United\n        States show very different patterns of wealth inequality, with Japan\n        having a low wealth Gini of .55 and the U.S. having around .80. The\n        incomes of the top fifth of the Japanese population are only three times\n        that of the bottom fifth, compared to nine times in the U.S. Japan has\n        little economic apartheid compared to the U.S., yet both countries have\n        a huge number of wealthy people. Of the wealthiest 10 percent in the\n        world, 25 percent are American, and 20 percent are Japanese. These two\n        countries are even stronger among the richest 1 percent of individuals\n        in the world, with 37 percent residing in the U.S. and 27 percent in\n        Japan. The point is that despite high numbers of very wealthy people,\n        economic apartheid is absent in Japan and abysmal in the U.S\n      </p>\n      <h4>Questions 1 - 7</h4>\n      <p>Complete the notes below.</p>\n      <p>\n        Write <b>NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS AND/ OR A NUMBER</b> from the passage\n        for each answer.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          According to a UN report, the world’s wealth distribution is\n          drastically 1\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          In 2000, the wealthiest 1% had 40% of global wealth, while 10% owned 2\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          In contrast, just 1% of riches was shared by the 3\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" /> .\n        </li>\n        <li>More than a billion people survive on less than a dollar daily</li>\n        <li>\n          Poverty causes the death of more than 4\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" /> children annually.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Wealth imbalance among nations:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          In 2000, per capita wealth in Japan and America were $181,000 and $\n          144,000 respectively, but a mere $1100 in India.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Inequality is measured in terms of 5 <input className=\"optionClass\" />\n          , which ranges from 0 to 1.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Japan has less 6 <input className=\"optionClass\" /> than the U.S.\n          though both have a large number of very rich people.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Americans tend to save less, leading to less wealth accumulation.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The U.S. example indicates that more 7\n          <input className=\"optionClass\" /> can result in serious social\n          imbalance.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  `,\n  header14: `\n    <div className=\"header2Class\">\n      <h2>Yes/no/not given Practice exercise</h2>\n      <p>\n        Answer questions <b>1-6</b> which are based on the reading passage\n        below.\n      </p>\n      <h3>\n        <b>Dependence On Technology Reading Passage</b>\n      </h3>\n      <p>\n        Reaching the moon, multiplying two 12 digit numbers instantly, searching\n        trillions of gigabytes of information at one go has all been made\n        possible due to technology. It has realized possibilities that would\n        have otherwise been considered a mammoth task to complete. Imagining a\n        life without technological devices in the vicinity is an unpleasant\n        thought for most people. But is the dependence desirable or does it have\n        its downside too?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In a survey conducted in the US, people were asked if society has become\n        dependent on technology. Out of the total responses, 77% of people\n        believed that dependence on technology has increased at an alarming\n        rate. According to a study, 6% of school-going teenagers in China are\n        addicted to the internet. In South Korea, the figures are likely to\n        reach 10%. These results are not surprising. Today, if teenagers are\n        asked the meaning of a particular word or to state their opinion on a\n        given issue, they will instantly reach for their mobile and the internet\n        instead of referring to a physical dictionary or a book for information.\n        Turning pages of physical books are relatively time-consuming, but it\n        does not necessarily mean that the much-trusted technology will always\n        be able to deliver better.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        We have improved with technology, but we have not thought of an\n        alternative if technology does not work. The most recent examples are\n        the outages at the New York Stock Exchange when a break-down in the\n        system took three-and-half hours to resolve and resume trading, halting\n        the overall pace of Wall Street. Another such example is a minor router\n        issue at United Airlines which grounded its planes for two hours leading\n        to 800 flight delays. These are just a couple of the many incidents of a\n        technical outage. While the technology in use may be state-of-the-art,\n        having a reliable backup is equally important.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Sophisticated systems in various areas such as airlines, military, or\n        electric grids add to the convenience. However, there are inherent\n        risks. For example, even upgraded security systems may be vulnerable to\n        the slightest malfunction. A minor change in readings, codes, or chips\n        with malicious intent may harm innocent people and society at large.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Online networking, a gift of advanced technology, has become a part of\n        our daily lives and its advantages are undeniable. However, it has\n        changed our daily interactions and can change our social structure too.\n        Face-to-face meetings have been replaced by chats and text messages on\n        social media. Reduced face-to-face interaction has kept smartphone users\n        away from real-life situations. The virtual world cannot replace\n        real-life situations that demand communication skills, problem-solving\n        skills, tolerance, and receptivity to coexist in society.

However, we have not always appreciated the magnitude of change in the\n    soil, water, and nutrient balances, the resultant degradation, and the costs to the wider Australian community. The\n    timeframe for these changes is to be slowed or reversed. Changes to the Australian landscape have resulted in the\n    widespread and rapidly growing problem of dryland salinity. Farmers were among the first to be affected, by the\n    salinization of rivers and agricultural land. Biodiversity, as well as regional and urban infrastructure, such as\n    water supply, roads and buildings, are now also at risk. Two broad forms of salinity are recognized in Australia.\n    Primary or naturally occurring salinity is part of the Australian landscape and reflects the development of this\n    landscape over time. Examples are the marine plains found around the coastline of Australia and the salt lakes in\n    central and Western Australia. Salts are distributed widely across Australian landscapes. They originate mainly from\n    depositions of oceanic salt from rain and wind. Salt stored in the soil or groundwater is concentrated through\n    evaporation and transpiration by plants. In a healthy catchment, salt is slowly leached downwards and stored below\n    the root zone, or out of the system. Secondary salinity is the salinization of land and water resources due to land\n    use impacts by people. It includes salinity that results from water table rises from irrigation systems — irrigation\n    salinity, and from dryland management systems — dryland salinity. Both forms of salinity are due to accelerated\n    rising water tables mobilizing salt in the soil. There is no fundamental difference in the hydrologic process. Where\n    the water balance has been altered due to changing land use (e.g. clearing of native vegetation for broadacre\n    farming or grazing), the excess water entering the water table mobilizes salt which then rises to the land surface.\n    The movement of water drives salinization processes and may move the stored salt towards the soil surface or into\n    surface water bodies.</p>\n
