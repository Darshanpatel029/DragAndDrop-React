            A greenhouse is a house made entirely of glass: both walls and roof
            are glass. One of the main purposes of a greenhouse is to grow
            tomatoes, flowers and other plants that might struggle to grow
            outside. A greenhouse stays warm inside, even during winter.
            Sunlight shines in and warms the plants and air inside. But the heat
            is trapped by the glass and cannot escape. So during the daylight
            hours, it gets warmer and warmer inside a greenhouse, and stays
            quite warm at night too.

            The Earth experiences a similar thing to a greenhouse. Gases in the
            atmosphere such as carbon dioxide do what the roof of a greenhouse
            does. During the day, the Sun shines through the atmosphere. Earth’s
            surface warms up in the sunlight. At night, Earth’s surface cools,
            releasing the heat back into the air. But some of the heat is
            trapped by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. That is what
            keeps our Earth a warm and comfortable 59 degrees Fahrenheit, on
            average.

            Many scientists agree that the damage to the Earth’s atmosphere and
            climate is past the point of no return or that the damage is near
            the point of no return. In Josef Werne’s opinion, an associate
            professor at the department of geology & planetary science at the
            University of Pittsburgh told Live Science, we have three options.
            Firstly to do nothing and live with the consequences. Secondly, to
            adapt to the changing climate (which includes things like rising sea
            level and related flooding). Thirdly, mitigate the impact of climate
            change by aggressively enacting policies that actually reduce the
            concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

        <h3>Incredible Journeys Reading Passage</h3>
        <div>
          <strong>A.</strong>
          <span>
            The nervous system of the desert ant Cataglyphis fortis, with around
            100,000 neurons, is about 1 millionth the size of a human brain.
            Yet, in the featureless deserts of Tunisia, this ant can venture
            over 100 meters from its nest to find food without becoming lost.
            Imagine randomly wandering 20 kilometres in the open desert, your
            tracks obliterated by the wind, then turning around and making a
            beeline to your starting point - and no GPS allowed! That's the
            equivalent of what the desert ant accomplishes with its scant neural
            resources. How does it do it?
          </span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>B</strong>
          <span>
            Jason, a graduate student studying the development of human and
            animal cognition, discusses a remarkable series of experiments on
            the desert ant on his blog, The Thoughtful Animal. In work spanning
            more than 30 years, researchers from Rüdiger Wehner's laboratory at
            the University of Zurich Institute of Zoology carefully tracked the
            movements of ants in the desert as the insects foraged for food. One
            of the researchers' key questions was how the ants calculated the
            direction to their nest.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>C</strong>
          <span>
            To check for the possibility that the ants used landmarks as visual
            cues, despite the relatively featureless desert landscape, the
            researchers engaged in a bit of trickery. They placed a food source
            at a distance from a nest, then tracked the nest's ants until the
            ants found the food. Once the food was found, the ants were
            relocated from that point so that the way back to their nest was a
            different direction than it would have been otherwise. The relocated
            ants walked away from the nest, in the same direction they should
            have walked if they had never been moved. This suggested that the
            ants are not following features, but orienting themselves relative
            to an internal navigation system or (as turned out to be the case)
            the position of the Sun in the sky.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>D</strong>
          <span>
            No matter how convoluted a route the ants take to find the food,
            they always return in a straight-line path, heading directly home.
            The researchers discovered the ants navigation system isn't perfect,
            small errors arise depending on how circuitous their initial route
            was. But the ants account for these errors as well, by walking in a
            corrective zigzag pattern as they approach the nest. So how do the
            ants know how far to travel? It could still be that they are
            visually tracking the distance they walk. The researchers tested
            this by painting over the ants' eyes for their return trip, but the
            ants still walked the correct distance, indicating that the ants are
            not using sight to measure their journeys.
          </span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>E</strong>
          <span>
            Another possibility is that the ants simply count their steps. In a
            remarkable experiment published in Science in 2006, scientists
            painstakingly attached 'stilts' made of pig hairs to some of the
            ants' legs, while other ants had their legs clipped, once they had
            reached their food target. If the ants counted their steps on the
            journey out, then the newly short-legged ants should stop short of
            the nest, while stilted ants should walk past it. Indeed, this is
            what occurred! Ants count their steps to track their location. (If
            only you had remembered to do this before you started on your
            20-kilometre desert trek!)

            But other creatures have different navigation puzzles to solve. In a
            separate post, Jason explains a study showing how maternal gerbils
            find their nests. When a baby is removed from the nest, the gerbil
            mother naturally tries to find and retrieve it. Researchers placed
            one of the babies in a cup at the centre of a platform, shrouded in
            darkness. When the mother found the baby, the platform was rotated.
            Did she head for the new position of her nest, with its scents and
            sounds of crying babies? No, she went straight to the spot where the
            nest had been, ignoring all these other cues. For gerbils, relying
            on the internal representation of their environment normally
            suffices, so the other information goes unheeded.

            Migratory birds, on the other hand, must navigate over much larger
            distances, some of them returning to the identical geographic spot
            year after year. How do they manage this trick? One component,
            University of Auckland researcher and teacher Fabiana Kubke reports,
            is the ability to detect the Earth's magnetic field. Though we've
            known about this avian sixth sense for some time, the location of a
            bird's magnetic detector is still somewhat of a mystery. Last
            November, however, a team led by Manuela Zapka published a letter in
            Nature that narrowed the possibilities. Migratory European Robins
            have magnetic material in their beaks, but also molecules called
            cryptochromes in the back of their eyes that might be used as a sort
            of compass. The team systematically cut the connections between
            these two areas and the Robins' brains, finding that the ability to
            orient to compass points was only disturbed when the connection to
            cryptochromes was disrupted.

            Much remains to be learned about how birds can successfully migrate
            over long distances. Unlike ants and gerbils, they can easily
            correct for large displacements in location and return to the
            correct spot.

        <h2>A Secret Well Kept Reading Passage</h2>
        <p>
          Political leaders in the days before the internet and 24-hour cable
          news were not subjected to the intense media scrutiny that their
          modern counterparts face. It was possible to rise to power and stay in
          office despite having skeletons in the closet that would now see one
          disgraced in a scandal. One of the best examples of keeping damaging
          secrets from the public was Canadian Prime Minister, Lyon Mackenzie
          King, (almost always referred to as Mackenzie King).
        </p>
        <p>
          Mackenzie King was born in 1874 with the proverbial silver spoon. He
          accumulated five university degrees, including a PhD from Harvard in
          economics, a subject he went on to teach at that institute. In
          addition to being a professor and an economist, King was a lawyer and
          a journalist. He was also a civil servant and was appointed as
          Canada's first Minister of Labour. He was elected to Parliament as a
          Liberal and would go on to become Canada’s, and the Commonwealth's
          longest-serving prime minister, serving for nearly 22 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mackenzie King cut his political teeth as a labour negotiator. He was
          successful in part because he mastered the art of conciliation.
          Conciliation, along with half measures, would become his trademark.
          'Do nothing by halves that can be done by quarters,” one detractor
          wrote of him. And so, King sought the middle ground in order to keep
          the country’s many factions together. He would go out of his way to
          avoid debate and was fond of saying 'Parliament will decide,' when
          pressed for an answer. He was pudgy, plodding, wooden and cold, and
          his speeches were slumber-inducing. Unloved, but practical and astute,
          he has been called Canada's greatest prime minister. He created old
          age pensions, unemployment insurance, and family allowance, and he
          left the country in much better shape than when he inherited it.

          Mackenzie King died in 1950, thus passing into the mildly-interesting
          annals of Canadian history. Then, during the seventies, his diaries
          (all 30,000 pages of them) were published, and millions of Canadian
          jaws dropped. It turns out that King, that monotonous embodiment of
          Presbyterian morals, was a dedicated occultist who communicated with
          the dead, including his mother (who he revered), former President
          Roosevelt, Leonardo da Vinci, and his dogs. And he did this almost
          every evening for the last 25 years of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          King used a Ouija board and owned a crystal ball. He read tea leaves.
          He employed mediums and consulted a psychic. He visited palmists. He
          was a numerologist, always sensitive to what the numbers 7 and 17 were
          attempting to reveal to him. He thought that when he looked at the
          clock and found both hands in alignment, someone from the other side
          must have been watching over him. King was careful not to reveal any
          of his 'psychical research' to the public, his departed mother having
          warned him that people wouldn't understand.

        <h3>Travel is the best form of education Reading Passage</h3>
        <p>
          One learns a lot while serving in the United States Army. Foreing
          places, stressful conditions, and absence from home can foster an
          out-of-the-classroom education that crosses the boundary of the odd
          and unusual. Today, tales of strange sea creatures and haunted islands
          seem like a bad Sci-Fi marathon. But these were realities for one U.S.
          Army soldier stationed overseas at the thrun of the 20th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          The art of journal keeping, letter writing and daily diary entries are
          becoming extinct as methods of memory management are changing in
          today's technology driven world. What once was detailed on paper with
          memory fresh at hand is now posted on YouTube Today, blogs replace
          diary entries. Hand-written letters to loved ones are far slower than
          a quick Facebook 'poke' or a cell phone text message.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historians enjoy a deep appreciation for the written word. They savour
          the ability to see the world through the eyes of someone who never had
          satellite TV, the Internet or cell phone. Where explanation was not
          readily at hand in the strange lands of the Philippine Islands, the
          environment was ripe for adventure and the unknown. Placing one's self
          in such situations fosters an education that cannot be duplicated in
          any classroom, book or blockbuster movie. A survivor of deadly and
          savage situations, Colonel Horace P. Hoobs recorded these
          well-documented experiences that lend a degree of depth to the
          retelling and re-imagining of Army history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The odd education of Colonel Horace P. Hobbs is revealed in his
          voluminous personal papers held at the U.S. Army Military History
          Institute. A letter of August 16, 1918, soothes his wife while he is
          stationed in France during World War I. 'You see it is the women who
          suffer most during a war. Now I know you and mother are worrying about
          me and I am living in the most luxurious comfort and perfect safety
          just now.' He goes to great lengths to explain his lush surroundings
          and the comfort he is experiencing, from bathing in a nearby brook to
          the size of his room and the servants who provide for him, as he
          attempts to console a worry-sick wife. It would seem, however, that
          Mrs Hobbs had been through worse as a military spouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her husband was stationed in the Philippines during the insurrection
          from 1899 to 1901. Colonel Hobbs wrote a book from his collected
          journals and memoirs entitled, 'Kris and Krag: Adventures among the
          Moros of the Southern Philippine Islands'. Among his many tales, the
          Colonel tells about a strange native custom on one of the small
          islands of taking their boats across a narrow strait to another island
          and returning before dark. They explained to him that the island was
          the home of the 'wok-wok', a powerful ghost who must be appeased with
          gifts of rice so they will not harm the people. Upon further
          inspection, the Army discovered the 'wok-wok’ to be large apes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another bizarre chapter in the Colonel's education came when he was
          asked by some villagers to kill a sea creature which wreaked havoc
          among the people whenever they Slaughtered an animal for food. The
          blood would run into the water, and out would come the creature. The
          Colonel waited for the apparition to appear after a slaughter, and he
          was not disappointed. Upon further inspection he described the animal
          as being some kind of mix between an alligator and a crocodile, but
          one he had never seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience in foreign places, blended with curiosity and a desire to
          learn, enabled Colon to obtain a far greater grasp of the world. These
          traits provided him with an education that the average person today
          cannot obtain from watching television or searching the web.

        <h2>Summary Completion</h2>
        <h2>Evolution Of Museums Reading Passage</h2>
        <b>Part A</b>
        <p>
          The very first museums of the world were private collections of
          objects by wealthy people and institutions. The objects in these
          museums were displayed in Cabinets of Curiosities, also called
          Cabinets of Wonder or Wonder Rooms. The word “cabinet” was then used
          to describe a room and not a piece of furniture. The oldest recorded
          example of such was the Ennigaldi Nanna’s museum that was located in
          Mesopotamia. It was founded in 530 BC.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the 18th century, only elite or respectable members of society,
          by the standards of that era, could visit museums with permission from
          the owner and the staff. The first museums to be opened for the
          general public were the British Museum in London in 1759 and the
          Uffizi Gallery in Florence in 1765. However, even though they were no
          longer exclusive places, only people from the middle and upper
          className were privileged with a written permission request. Also, the
          visitations were often limited to a few hours. The first public museum
          in its true sense was the Louvre in Paris which was opened in 1793 to
          people of any status and age, emerging as an agent of nationalistic
          fervor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, societies began
          to regard museums as centers of the production of new knowledge.
          Historical museums shifted focus to display scientific discoveries and
          artistic developments with collections that could be useful for
          research also. Over the twentieth century, as cities increased in
          size, wealth, and population, more museums developed. These were
          shaped by the public response to education and entertainment. Greater
          funding was directed towards the development of modern museums. Study
          programs dedicated to the field of art and culture were created to
          promote the growth of museums, and activities such as the collection
          and preservation of artifacts such as paintings or sculptures had
          consequently become more organized. Even wealthy industrialists such
          as Henry Ford and Henry Mercer contributed their collections leading
          to the development of more privately run museums.
        </p>
        <b>Part B</b>
        <p>
          A breeze of change was once again felt in the early 21st century.
          Museums were no longer anchored to the national ideal and today’s new
          museums attract intellectuals as well as tourists and students.
          Attitudes toward museums have become more favorable as people no
          longer view them as boring, cold places that drag you to the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the main factors that have contributed to this is technology.
          Modern museums have embraced technology with considerable use of
          multimedia, digital displays, touch screens as well as other
          interactive technologies. Some museums, such as the Metropolitan
          Museum of Art in New York, use technology that allows visitors to see
          the objects, hear or read about the collection on their smartphones by
          scanning the artwork. Other national museums have also followed suit
          by embracing mobile interactivity. The Smithsonian Institution, which
          is the world’s largest museum and research complex containing 19
          museums and galleries, provides cell phone tours, interactive games
          like Pheon, which is a multimedia scavenger hunt game, multilingual
          slideshows, and even augmented reality apps such as one from the
          postal museum showing Owney, the mascot of the Railway Mail Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, there are some museums such as the National Museum of
          African Art that have the Artists in Dialogue 2 app, which allows for
          visual calls and responses that cut across physical and political
          borders. The app facilitates a guided tour of the museum with the
          curator virtually, and also allows the user to experiment with the
          artistic technique in a virtual art-development game. The user can
          even communicate with active groups of the museum on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, technology has provided modern-day museums with the
          opportunity to share images and works of art with more people than
          ever before. However, the conclusion is that technology is enhancing
          and not replacing the brick and mortar museums since technology cannot
          replace a live experience for the viewer such as live interaction with
          the experts, emotional reactions, and the physicality of artworks.

          It is essential when conducting this experiment to wear safety
          goggles. This experiment is divided into four distinct sections. The
          first, the reaction stage, is when a glass beaker is placed on top of
          a tripod, and 20cm of dilute sulphuric acid poured into it. The acid
          is then heated. When it is almost boiling, a small quantity of copper
          oxide powder is added to the beaker. The mixture is then stirred with
          a glass spatula until the copper oxide has dissolved. This process is
          then repeated until 1g of powder has been added to the sulphuric acid.
          The heat is then removed from the beaker and the solution allowed to
          cool. The second stage is the filtration stage and, as the name
          suggests, is where a filter and conical flask are used to remove any
          copper oxide that has not reacted. A clear copper sulphate solution
          will be left in the glass dish. The third stage is where heat is
          applied to the copper sulphate solution in order to concentrate the
          solution: the concentration stage. The final crystallization stage
          happens when the solution begins to cool, and pure copper sulphate
          crystals start to form.

          <b>The Penny Black Reading Passage</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In 1840, the United Kingdom introduced the penny black, the first
          adhesive postage stamp issued anywhere in the world.For many years the
          postal service in the U.K. had been a very expensive service for
          ordinary people to use. The costs were prohibitive, a single letter
          sometimes costing a working person’s full day’s wage. The postal
          system also had many strange anomalies, such as certain categories of
          mail going free (and therefore being paid for by the charges on
          others), newspapers going for nothing, most mail being paid for by the
          addressee rather than by the sender, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were moves for postal reform for many years, until eventually
          these moves started gathering some force through the attention of
          many, amongst whom Rowland Hill is the best known, and Robert Wallace,
          MP for Greenock, was instrumental.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story is long and involved, but eventually, The Penny Postage Bill
          was passed by Parliament on 17 August 1839. Some basic elements of the
          plan were the lowering of postage rates for basic letters to one
          penny, the removal of certain idiosyncrasies, that prepayment would
          become normal, and the availability of printed envelopes, letter
          sheets, and labels to show prepayment. The “labels” were the penny
          black and twopence blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bookseller and printer from Dundee, James Chalmers, holds a strong
          claim to be the actual inventor of the adhesive postage stamp. He is
          said to have been interested in postal reform from about 1822, and to
          have printed samples of his idea for printed gummed labels in August
          1834. It seems that, although Hill also presented the idea of adhesive
          stamps, he was probably keener on the use of standard prepaid letter
          folders, such as were issued in 1840 using a design by William
          Mulready.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new stamps went on sale on 1st May 1840 and were valid for postage
          from 6th May 1840 (although some were used during the 1st-5th May
          period). The Mulreadies were issued at the same time. Public reaction
          to these new items was quite the opposite to Rowland Hill’s
          expectations. The labels were well-received and admired; the Mulready
          design was lambasted and ridiculed. Initial supplies of the stamps
          were rushed through the printing and distribution process, but
          supplies soon caught up with requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stamps were printed in sheets of 240, engraved on steel plates, on
          gummed paper with a single small crown watermark on each stamp. Eleven
          different printing plates were used, and it is possible in almost
          every case to work out which plate any individual stamp was printed
          from by a few characteristics. Things like the positioning of the
          corner letters within their squares, the presence of the “O flaw”,
          which rays of the stars in the upper corners are broken at what
          points, and so on, can point to a correct plate identification, but
          more specialised literature is required in order to do this. Some
          plates are scarcer than others, plate 11 being the scarcest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every penny black stamp has letters in the lower two corners. These
          simply identify what sheet position the stamp occupied. When the
          printing plates were produced the lower squares were blank, and the
          letters were punched in by hand. The left square letter shows which
          horizontal row the stamp was in – the first row being A, the second B,
          and so on down to the twentieth row with T. The right square letter
          indicates the vertical column, again with A for the first column, B,
          C, and so on across to L for the last (twelfth) column. It should be
          noted therefore that each letter combination is just as common or as
          scarce as any other.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were 68,158,080 penny blacks issued (yes, 68 million!), and even
          with only a 2% survival rate, there are likely to be about 1.3 million
          still in existence. The survival rate may well be considerably higher
          than 2%, as it should be remembered that in 1840 the use of envelopes
          was unusual, most letters being written, folded, and sealed with
          sealing wax; this meant that whenever a letter was filed in a lawyer’s
          office, bank, etc., the whole thing would be kept – letter and outer
          cover including the adhesive stamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the collector's perspective, the physical condition of the stamp
          – any fault such as a thin, tear, crease, or stain will lower the
          value, and the number, size, and regularity of the margins make a big
          difference to value. The stamps were not perforated and had to be
          separated using scissors or a knife. As there was only about 1mm
          between one stamp and another, it was very easy to stray just a little
          and cut into the printed design of the stamp. A stamp with two full
          margins and perhaps a couple of other part margins is about average.
          Collectors will pay higher prices for examples with four good, wide,
          and even margins.

        <h3>Objects From Different Civilizations Reading Passage</h3>
        <p>
          Objects from lost civilisations can tell us about the social
          relationships and the way of life of the people belonging to those
          societies. The Indus valley civilisation and the Chinese civilisation
          have been influential with their innovations and contributions to
          advanced technology. The Indus Valley civilization is also called the
          Harappan civilization. Developing along the mighty Indus River, it was
          at its peak around 2500 and 3500 BC. This Bronze Age civilisation is
          believed to be among the oldest world civilisations together with the
          Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilisations. The famous figurine of the
          dancing girl from the Harappa region shows the advances made in art
          and metallurgy at the time. The statue describes details such as the
          hairstyle and ornaments prevalent then such as the more than 20
          bangles in her left arm and four on her right arm, and the necklace.
          Although the bronze statuette is in standing position, it was named
          the dancing girl by assuming that it was her profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seals are other famous objects from the Bronze Age. Seals are
          beautifully carved out of stone and then fired for durability. Over
          3,500 seals discovered are mostly square with different symbols at the
          top, an animal in the centre and a few more symbols at the bottom are,
          which are presumed to be the inscription of the Indus valley language.
          The inscription indicates that people of this age wrote the first line
          from right to left, the second line from left to right and so on. Some
          common animal inscriptions on these seals include elephants, unicorns,
          rhinoceros, and bulls. On the reverse face, most seals have
          projections with a hole to possibly carry it comfortably. The imprint
          on some of the seals suggests that they were used as clay tags for
          sacks of traded goods such as grain, which means that the Harappan
          people were involved in long-distance trading networks. Hunting tools
          show that the Indus people were fond of game. Many of the toys are
          carts and animals made from baked clay, and most were for children,
          which has led to the conclusion that the people had an active social
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standardised measurement is another valuable contribution of the Indus
          valley people. The oldest ruler with markings was a copper alloy rod
          found by a German archaeologist and he claims that it was used as a
          standard measurement unit. He mentions that the measurements on the
          ruler are divided into units that correspond to 1.32 inches which are
          further divided into perfectly calculated decimal subdivisions.
          Measurements of the bricks found in excavations of the Mohenjo Daro
          and Harappan civilisations match with those on the ruler mentioned by
          the German archaeologist.
        </p>
        <p>
          China was the first nation to invent paper. In the older
          civilisations, words were written on natural materials such as grass
          stalks, earthen plates, wood and bamboo strips, tree leaves, and
          sheepskins. The first paper from the Chinese people was known as bo
          and was made of silk. However, it was expensive. In the 2nd century, a
          new kind of paper was produced from rags, bark, wheat stalks, and
          other materials, which was not only cheaper but was also durable and
          could be used for brush writing. Papermaking had spread to other parts
          of the world in the beginning of the third century. Ancient China also
          gets credit for the invention of gunpowder. In a collection of most
          important military techniques as described in Wujing Zongyao that was
          edited in 1044 by Zeng Gong Liang, three formulas of making gunpowder
          were discovered and have been described as the earliest formulas of
          such kinds. Another significant gift from China was the compass. It
          was developed after some miners got hold of a piece of a natural
          magnetite that attracted iron and pointed north. The compass that we
          use today is a result of a series of improvements to the earliest
          design. Before it was invented, navigators depended on the position of
          the moon, sun, and the polestar for their bearings.

        <h3>The Halifax Explosion Reading Passage</h3>
        <p>
          Before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, the
          largest-ever non-natural explosion had taken place in 1917 in the
          eastern Canadian port city of Halifax. With the outbreak of World War
          I, Halifax was effectively transformed into a boomtown. Convoys
          gathered weekly in Bedford Basin (the north-western end of Halifax
          Harbour) in order to traverse the Atlantic, and Halifax Harbour became
          heavy with vessels of one variety or another. This spike in boat
          traffic was not dealt with efficiently, and collisions became almost
          normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          On December 1st, 1917, the French vessel Mont Blanc left New York in
          order to join a convoy in Halifax after being loaded with 226,797
          kilograms of TNT (an explosive), 223,188 kilograms of benzol (a type
          of gasoline), 1,602,519 kilograms of wet picric acid (an explosive),
          and 544,311 kilograms of dry picric acid (another explosive). On
          December 6th, the Mont Blanc was ushered into Halifax’s harbour after
          the U-boat nets had been raised.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, the cargoless Norwegian ship, Imo, left Bedford
          Basin en route to New York in order to pick up relief items for
          transport to war-torn Belgium. Imo was behind schedule and attempting
          to remedy that. She passed a boat on the wrong side before sending a
          tugboat retreating to port. By the time she reached the Narrows, she
          was in the wrong channel and going too fast. The Mont Blanc sounded
          her whistle, but the Imo sounded back twice, refusing to alter course.
          At the last moment, the Mont Blanc veered, and the Imo reversed, but
          it was too late. From the gash formed in the French boat’s hull seeped
          a noxious spiral of oily, orange-dappled smoke. Mont Blanc’s crew
          rowed to shore on the Dartmouth side, but no one could decipher their
          warnings. Their fiery vessel then casually drifted toward the Halifax
          side where it came to rest against one of the piers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This spectacle drew thousands of onlookers. People crowded docks and
          windows filled with curious faces. As many as 1,600 died instantly
          when the boat exploded. Around 9,000 were injured, 6,000 seriously so.
          Approximately 12,000 buildings were severely damaged; virtually every
          building in town was damaged to some extent; 1,630 were rendered
          nonexistent. Around 6,000 people were made homeless, and 25,000 people
          (half the population) were left without suitable housing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Halifax Explosion, as it became known, was the largest manmade
          detonation to date, approximately one-fifth the ferocity of the bomb
          later dropped on Hiroshima. It sent up a column of smoke reckoned to
          be 7,000 metres in height. It was felt more than 480 kilometres away.
          It flung a ship gun barrel some 5.5 kilometres, and part of an anchor,
          which weighed 517 kilograms, around 3 kilometres. The blast absolutely
          flattened a district known as Richmond. It also caused a tsunami that
          saw a wave 18 metres above the high-water mark depositing the Imo onto
          the shore of the Dartmouth side. The pressure wave of air that was
          produced snapped trees, bent iron rails, and grounded ships. That
          evening, a blizzard commenced, and it would continue until the next
          day, leaving 40 centimetres of snow in its wake. Consequently, many of
          those trapped within collapsed structures died of exposure. Historians
          put the death toll of the Halifax Explosion at approximately 2,000.

        <h3>
          <b>The Dingo - An Australian Pest Reading Passage</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The origins of the dingo are obscure, and there is much controversy
          connected with this. It is not truly native to Australia but is
          thought to have arrived between 3,500 and 4,000 years ago. Whatever
          its origins, the dingo was a highly valued companion to the
          aborigines. They were hunting companions, guard dogs, and they kept
          them warm at night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some believe they were brought here on rafts or boats by the ancestral
          aborigines. It has also been suggested that they came with Indonesian
          or South-East Asian fishermen who visited the northern coast of
          Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dingo can be found in all areas of Australia - from harsh deserts
          to lush rainforest The highly adaptable dingo is found in every
          habitat and every state of Australia,except Tasmania. In deserts,
          access to drinking water determines where the animal can live.
          Purebred dingo numbers in the wild are declining as man encroaches
          deeper and deeper into wilderness areas, often accompanied by his
          domestic dog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dingo is different from the modern dog in several ways: it does
          not bark, it has a different gait, and its ears are always erect.
          Dingoes are naturally lean, and they are usually cream to
          reddish-yellow with white points, some are black with tan points. An
          adult dingo stands more than 60cm high and weighs about 15kg. It is
          slightly smaller than a German Shepherd.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its natural state, the dingo lives either alone or in a small
          group, unlike many other wild dog species which may form packs.
          Dingoes have a clearly defined territory which they rarely leave and
          which they protect from other dingoes, but which may be shared with
          dingoes when they form a group to hunt larger prey. The size of the
          home territory varies according to the food supply. Dingoes hunt
          mainly at night. Groups are controlled by dominant male. Members of a
          group maintain contact by marking rocks and trees within the
          territory, and by howling, particularly in the breeding season.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dingo's diet consists of native mammals, including kangaroos,
          although domestic animals and some farm stock are also on the menu.
          This makes the animal unpopular with farmers. The dingo is thought to
          have contributed to the mainland extinction of the thylacine through
          increased competition for food.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dingo is an intelligent animal. It is no more dangerous to man
          than any other feral dog. The natural prey of the dingo is small
          mammals and ground-dwelling birds, but with the introduction of white
          settlement, they became such a menace to sheep, calves and poultry
          that measures had to be taken in an attempt to control them, such as
          dog-proof fences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dingoes start breeding when they reach the age of one or two but only
          the dominant members within an established group breed. They breed
          only once a year. Mating usually occurs in autumn/early winter, and
          after a gestation of nine weeks (same as domestic dogs), a litter
          averaging 4-5 pups is born, which are reared in a hollow log, a
          rock-shelter, or an old rabbit warren. Both parents take part in
          raising the pups. The pups are fully grown at seven months of age. A
          dingo may live for up to ten years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wild dingoes are wary of humans and do not attack unless provoked.
          They will approach camps in the bush looking for food or perhaps out
          of curiosity. Dingoes can be kept as pets but should be obtained at a
          very young age to enable them to bond with humans. Even when raised
          from pups they never seem to lose their instinct for killing poultry
          or small animals. Not all states in Australia allow dingoes to be kept
          as pets and a permit is required. The export of dingoes is illegal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dingoes and domestic dogs interbreed freely resulting in very few
          pure-bred, southern or eastern Australia. This threatens the dingo's
          ability to survive as a separate species. Public hostility is another
          threat to the dingo. Because it takes some livestock, the dingo is
          considered by many to be a pest.

          <b>Doll Restoration Reading Passage</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is a good example of how the average doll collector receives a
          doll. They will find a beautiful antique doll that does not look as
          beautiful as it should, but with proper restoration, she can be as
          beautiful as the day she was created. Here, there are two main
          problems, the eye mechanism has lost its original look, and it has a
          loose head. We removed the mohair wig and removed the eye system. Then
          we separated the head from the composition body and chemically cleaned
          the head, removing old dirt, and wax, but not harming the original
          artwork. We repaired the missing porcelain teeth by making duplicate
          porcelain teeth to match and reinserted them. Then we took the
          original eye system and reconditioned it. We then did the waxing of
          the eye mechanism and reset the eyebar so the eyebar would open and
          close as it originally did. What a wonderful difference to chemically
          clean and restyle the original mohair wig. Our seamstress took over
          point with suggestions from the owner on likes and dislikes using
          original period designs. She now looked, I'm sure, very much as she
          would have originally looked when the little child fell in love with
          her for the first time.

      <h3>
        <b>Economic Apartheid Reading Passage</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        A new report from the World Institute for Development Economics Research
        of the United Nations University shows that wealth creation is
        remarkable, one might say, criminally, unequal. Follow this hierarchy at
        the top of the wealth pyramid: the richest 1 percent of adults alone
        owned 40 percent of global assets in the year 2000; the richest 2
        percent owned more than half of global household wealth, and the richest
        10 percent of adults accounted for 85% of the world total. That leaves
        very little for the remaining 90 percent of the global population. Could
        it be any worse? Yes, the rich are still getting richer, more
        millionaires are becoming billionaires.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to the world's lower className: the bottom half of the world's adult
        population owned barely 1 percent of global wealth, defined as net
        worth: the value of physical and financial assets fewer debts. Over a
        billion poor people subsist on less than one dollar a day. Every day,
        according to UNICEF, 30,000 children die due to poverty - that's over 10
        million children killed by poverty every year! Global economic apartheid
        is killing people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are data showing some of the variations among nations. Average
        wealth amounted to $144,000 per person in the U.S. in 2000, not as good
        as the $181,000 in Japan, but better than most others: $127,000 for the
        U.K., $70,000 for Denmark, $37,000 for New Zealand, $1,400 in Indonesia
        and $1,100 in India. Averages, of course, are very deceiving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The statistical measure of inequality is the Gini value, which measures
        inequality on a scale from zero (total equality) to one (complete
        inequality). For income, it ranges from .35 to .45 in most countries.
        Wealth inequality is usually much higher, typically between .65 and .75.
        This reflects the greater difficulty in accumulating wealth (capital)
        than increasing income. Two high wealth economies, Japan and the United
        States show very different patterns of wealth inequality, with Japan
        having a low wealth Gini of .55 and the U.S. having around .80. The
        incomes of the top fifth of the Japanese population are only three times
        that of the bottom fifth, compared to nine times in the U.S. Japan has
        little economic apartheid compared to the U.S., yet both countries have
        a huge number of wealthy people. Of the wealthiest 10 percent in the
        world, 25 percent are American, and 20 percent are Japanese. These two
        countries are even stronger among the richest 1 percent of individuals
        in the world, with 37 percent residing in the U.S. and 27 percent in
        Japan. The point is that despite high numbers of very wealthy people,
        economic apartheid is absent in Japan and abysmal in the U.S

      <h3>
        <b>Dependence On Technology Reading Passage</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Reaching the moon, multiplying two 12 digit numbers instantly, searching
        trillions of gigabytes of information at one go has all been made
        possible due to technology. It has realized possibilities that would
        have otherwise been considered a mammoth task to complete. Imagining a
        life without technological devices in the vicinity is an unpleasant
        thought for most people. But is the dependence desirable or does it have
        its downside too?
      </p>
      <p>
        In a survey conducted in the US, people were asked if society has become
        dependent on technology. Out of the total responses, 77% of people
        believed that dependence on technology has increased at an alarming
        rate. According to a study, 6% of school-going teenagers in China are
        addicted to the internet. In South Korea, the figures are likely to
        reach 10%. These results are not surprising. Today, if teenagers are
        asked the meaning of a particular word or to state their opinion on a
        given issue, they will instantly reach for their mobile and the internet
        instead of referring to a physical dictionary or a book for information.
        Turning pages of physical books are relatively time-consuming, but it
        does not necessarily mean that the much-trusted technology will always
        be able to deliver better.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have improved with technology, but we have not thought of an
        alternative if technology does not work. The most recent examples are
        the outages at the New York Stock Exchange when a break-down in the
        system took three-and-half hours to resolve and resume trading, halting
        the overall pace of Wall Street. Another such example is a minor router
        issue at United Airlines which grounded its planes for two hours leading
        to 800 flight delays. These are just a couple of the many incidents of a
        technical outage. While the technology in use may be state-of-the-art,
        having a reliable backup is equally important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sophisticated systems in various areas such as airlines, military, or
        electric grids add to the convenience. However, there are inherent
        risks. For example, even upgraded security systems may be vulnerable to
        the slightest malfunction. A minor change in readings, codes, or chips
        with malicious intent may harm innocent people and society at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        Online networking, a gift of advanced technology, has become a part of
        our daily lives and its advantages are undeniable. However, it has
        changed our daily interactions and can change our social structure too.
        Face-to-face meetings have been replaced by chats and text messages on
        social media. Reduced face-to-face interaction has kept smartphone users
        away from real-life situations. The virtual world cannot replace
        real-life situations that demand communication skills, problem-solving
        skills, tolerance, and receptivity to coexist in society. 'They don't
        know how to handle conflict face to face because so many things happen
        through some sort of technology,' said Melissa Ortega, a child
        psychologist at New York's Child Mind Institute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technology has improved our way of life, but it should be used only as a
        tool. Relying on it to an extent where a technological detox becomes
        next to impossible is worrying. We must be technologically advanced and
        not technology dependent.

      <h3>
        <b>Salinity Reading Passage </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        It has long been recognized that our land uses, including agricultural
        development, have significantly changed Australia’s landscapes and
        natural systems. However, we have not always appreciated the magnitude
        of change in the soil, water, and nutrient balances, the resultant
        degradation, and the costs to the wider Australian community. The
        timeframe for these changes is to be slowed or reversed. Changes to the
        Australian landscape have resulted in the widespread and rapidly growing
        problem of dryland salinity. Farmers were among the first to be
        affected, by the salinization of rivers and agricultural land.
        Biodiversity, as well as regional and urban infrastructure, such as
        water supply, roads and buildings, are now also at risk. Two broad forms
        of salinity are recognized in Australia. Primary or naturally occurring
        salinity is part of the Australian landscape and reflects the
        development of this landscape over time. Examples are the marine plains
        found around the coastline of Australia and the salt lakes in central
        and Western Australia. Salts are distributed widely across Australian
        landscapes. They originate mainly from depositions of oceanic salt from
        rain and wind. Salt stored in the soil or groundwater is concentrated
        through evaporation and transpiration by plants. In a healthy catchment,
        salt is slowly leached downwards and stored below the root zone, or out
        of the system. Secondary salinity is the salinization of land and water
        resources due to land use impacts by people. It includes salinity that
        results from water table rises from irrigation systems — irrigation
        salinity, and from dryland management systems — dryland salinity. Both
        forms of salinity are due to accelerated rising water tables mobilizing
        salt in the soil. There is no fundamental difference in the hydrologic
        process. Where the water balance has been altered due to changing land
        use (e.g. clearing of native vegetation for broadacre farming or
        grazing), the excess water entering the water table mobilizes salt which
        then rises to the land surface. The movement of water drives
        salinization processes and may move the stored salt towards the soil
        surface or into surface water bodies.
